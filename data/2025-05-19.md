### [1] [Artificial Intelligence Bias on English Language Learners in Automatic Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10643)
*Shuchen Guo,Yun Wang,Jichao Yu,Xuansheng Wu,Bilgehan Ayik,Field M. Watts,Ehsan Latif,Ninghao Liu,Lei Liu,Xiaoming Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了自动评分系统对英语学习者（ELLs）的潜在评分偏见，发现训练数据量足够时无偏见，但样本量小（ELL=200）时可能存在偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究自动评分系统对ELLs的评分偏见及差异，尤其是训练数据不平衡的影响。

Method: 使用BERT模型，基于四种数据集（ELLs、非ELLs、不平衡混合、平衡混合）进行微调，分析21项评估题目，计算评分准确性和平均分差距（MSG）。

Result: 训练数据量大（ELL=30,000和1,000）时无偏见，样本量小（ELL=200）时可能存在偏见。

Conclusion: 训练数据量是减少自动评分系统对ELLs偏见的关键因素。

Abstract: This study investigated potential scoring biases and disparities toward
English Language Learners (ELLs) when using automatic scoring systems for
middle school students' written responses to science assessments. We
specifically focus on examining how unbalanced training data with ELLs
contributes to scoring bias and disparities. We fine-tuned BERT with four
datasets: responses from (1) ELLs, (2) non-ELLs, (3) a mixed dataset reflecting
the real-world proportion of ELLs and non-ELLs (unbalanced), and (4) a balanced
mixed dataset with equal representation of both groups. The study analyzed 21
assessment items: 10 items with about 30,000 ELL responses, five items with
about 1,000 ELL responses, and six items with about 200 ELL responses. Scoring
accuracy (Acc) was calculated and compared to identify bias using Friedman
tests. We measured the Mean Score Gaps (MSGs) between ELLs and non-ELLs and
then calculated the differences in MSGs generated through both the human and AI
models to identify the scoring disparities. We found that no AI bias and
distorted disparities between ELLs and non-ELLs were found when the training
dataset was large enough (ELL = 30,000 and ELL = 1,000), but concerns could
exist if the sample size is limited (ELL = 200).

### [2] [GeoGrid-Bench: Can Foundation Models Understand Multimodal Gridded Geo-Spatial Data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10714)
*Bowen Jiang,Yangxinyu Xie,Xiaomeng Wang,Jiashu He,Joshua Bergerson,John K Hutchison,Jordan Branham,Camillo J Taylor,Tanwi Mallick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GeoGrid-Bench是一个用于评估基础模型处理网格结构地理空间数据能力的基准测试，包含大规模真实数据和多样化任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地理空间数据具有密集数值、时空依赖和多模态表示的特点，需要评估基础模型在此领域的适用性。

Method: 基准测试包含16种气候变量、150个地点和3200个问题-答案对，问题由专家模板生成，涵盖从基础到复杂的任务。

Result: 视觉-语言模型表现最佳，研究提供了不同模型在地理空间任务中的优缺点分析。

Conclusion: GeoGrid-Bench为地理空间数据分析和科学研究提供了基础模型应用的清晰指导。

Abstract: We present GeoGrid-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of
foundation models to understand geo-spatial data in the grid structure.
Geo-spatial datasets pose distinct challenges due to their dense numerical
values, strong spatial and temporal dependencies, and unique multimodal
representations including tabular data, heatmaps, and geographic
visualizations. To assess how foundation models can support scientific research
in this domain, GeoGrid-Bench features large-scale, real-world data covering 16
climate variables across 150 locations and extended time frames. The benchmark
includes approximately 3,200 question-answer pairs, systematically generated
from 8 domain expert-curated templates to reflect practical tasks encountered
by human scientists. These range from basic queries at a single location and
time to complex spatiotemporal comparisons across regions and periods. Our
evaluation reveals that vision-language models perform best overall, and we
provide a fine-grained analysis of the strengths and limitations of different
foundation models in different geo-spatial tasks. This benchmark offers clearer
insights into how foundation models can be effectively applied to geo-spatial
data analysis and used to support scientific research.

### [3] [A Modular Approach for Clinical SLMs Driven by Synthetic Data with Pre-Instruction Tuning, Model Merging, and Clinical-Tasks Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10717)
*Jean-Philippe Corbeil,Amin Dada,Jean-Michel Attendu,Asma Ben Abacha,Alessandro Sordoni,Lucas Caccia,François Beaulieu,Thomas Lin,Jens Kleesiek,Paul Vozila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新框架MediPhi，用于将小型语言模型（SLMs）高效适配到临床领域，解决了计算成本高、数据敏感等问题，并在多个临床任务中显著优于基准模型和GPT-4。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（如GPT-4）在临床部署中的高计算成本和延迟问题，同时克服小型语言模型（SLMs）在生物医学领域适配中的挑战。

Method: 提出MediPhi框架，包括预指令调优、模型合并和临床任务对齐；扩展CLUE基准为CLUE+；构建MediFlow合成数据集。

Result: MediPhi在多个临床任务中表现优异，相对基准模型提升显著（如医学实体识别提升64.3%），并超越GPT-4-0125。

Conclusion: MediPhi框架成功将SLMs适配到临床领域，显著提升了性能，为临床NLP任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: High computation costs and latency of large language models such as GPT-4
have limited their deployment in clinical settings. Small language models
(SLMs) offer a cost-effective alternative, but their limited capacity requires
biomedical domain adaptation, which remains challenging. An additional
bottleneck is the unavailability and high sensitivity of clinical data. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for adapting SLMs into
high-performing clinical models. We introduce the MediPhi collection of
3.8B-parameter SLMs developed with our novel framework: pre-instruction tuning
of experts on relevant medical and clinical corpora (PMC, Medical Guideline,
MedWiki, etc.), model merging, and clinical-tasks alignment. To cover most
clinical tasks, we extended the CLUE benchmark to CLUE+, doubling its size. Our
expert models deliver relative improvements on this benchmark over the base
model without any task-specific fine-tuning: 64.3% on medical entities, 49.5%
on radiology reports, and 44% on ICD-10 coding (outperforming GPT-4-0125 by
14%). We unify the expert models into MediPhi via model merging, preserving
gains across benchmarks. Furthermore, we built the MediFlow collection, a
synthetic dataset of 2.5 million high-quality instructions on 14 medical NLP
tasks, 98 fine-grained document types, and JSON format support. Alignment of
MediPhi using supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization
achieves further gains of 18.9% on average.

### [4] [AI-enhanced semantic feature norms for 786 concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10718)
*Siddharth Suresh,Kushin Mukherjee,Tyler Giallanza,Xizheng Yu,Mia Patil,Jonathan D. Cohen,Timothy T. Rogers*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，结合人类生成的特征规范和大型语言模型（LLMs）的响应，创建了AI增强的特征规范数据集NOVA，显著提高了特征密度和概念重叠，并在预测人类语义相似性判断方面优于纯人类数据集和词嵌入模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语义特征规范方法在概念/特征覆盖范围和质量验证之间存在权衡，因为规范研究需要大量人工劳动。

Method: 通过结合人类生成的特征规范和LLMs的响应，并验证其质量，创建了AI增强的数据集NOVA。

Result: NOVA数据集在特征密度和概念重叠方面表现更优，且在预测人类语义相似性判断上优于纯人类数据集和词嵌入模型。

Conclusion: 人类概念知识比以往规范数据集所捕捉的更丰富，经过适当验证，LLMs可以成为认知科学研究的强大工具。

Abstract: Semantic feature norms have been foundational in the study of human
conceptual knowledge, yet traditional methods face trade-offs between
concept/feature coverage and verifiability of quality due to the
labor-intensive nature of norming studies. Here, we introduce a novel approach
that augments a dataset of human-generated feature norms with responses from
large language models (LLMs) while verifying the quality of norms against
reliable human judgments. We find that our AI-enhanced feature norm dataset,
NOVA: Norms Optimized Via AI, shows much higher feature density and overlap
among concepts while outperforming a comparable human-only norm dataset and
word-embedding models in predicting people's semantic similarity judgments.
Taken together, we demonstrate that human conceptual knowledge is richer than
captured in previous norm datasets and show that, with proper validation, LLMs
can serve as powerful tools for cognitive science research.

### [5] [Tracr-Injection: Distilling Algorithms into Pre-trained Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10719)
*Tomás Vergara-Browne,Álvaro Soto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为tracr-injection的方法，将RASP语言编写的算法直接注入预训练语言模型，以解决理论能力与实际学习能力之间的不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的兴起促使研究者形式化描述Transformer架构的符号能力，但RASP语言实现的任务难以从无监督数据中学习，理论与实际存在差距。

Method: 提出tracr-injection方法，将RASP算法直接蒸馏到预训练语言模型中，并展示了3种算法的注入效果。

Result: 方法在模型残差流中创建了可解释的子空间，并能解码为RASP代码中的变量；同时提高了分布外性能。

Conclusion: tracr-injection方法验证了模型内部更符号化的机制，并开源了实验代码。

Abstract: Motivated by the surge of large language models, there has been a push to
formally characterize the symbolic abilities intrinsic to the transformer
architecture. A programming language, called RASP, has been proposed, which can
be directly compiled into transformer weights to implement these algorithms.
However, the tasks that can be implemented in RASP are often uncommon to learn
from natural unsupervised data, showing a mismatch between theoretical
capabilities of the transformer architecture, and the practical learnability of
these capabilities from unsupervised data. We propose tracr-injection, a method
that allows us to distill algorithms written in RASP directly into a
pre-trained language model. We showcase our method by injecting 3 different
algorithms into a language model. We show how our method creates an
interpretable subspace within the model's residual stream, which can be decoded
into the variables present in the code of the RASP algorithm. Additionally, we
found that the proposed method can improve out of distribution performance
compared to our baseline, indicating that indeed a more symbolic mechanism is
taking place in the inner workings of the model. We release the code used to
run our experiments.

### [6] [Model Performance-Guided Evaluation Data Selection for Effective Prompt Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10736)
*Ximing Dong,Shaowei Wang,Dayi Lin,Ahmed E. Hassan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IPOMP是一种两阶段方法，通过语义聚类和边界分析选择代表性样本，并结合实时模型性能数据迭代优化提示，显著提升效果和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动提示工程效率低且效果不佳，现有自动化方法因随机评估子集导致不可靠结果，需改进。

Method: IPOMP采用语义聚类和边界分析选择样本，再通过实时性能数据迭代替换冗余样本。

Result: 在BIG-bench数据集上，IPOMP效果提升1.6%-5.3%，稳定性提升至少57%，计算开销低于1%。

Conclusion: IPOMP能有效优化提示，且其实时性能引导方法可通用增强现有核心集选择方法。

Abstract: Optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) performance requires well-crafted
prompts, but manual prompt engineering is labor-intensive and often
ineffective. Automated prompt optimization techniques address this challenge
but the majority of them rely on randomly selected evaluation subsets, which
fail to represent the full dataset, leading to unreliable evaluations and
suboptimal prompts. Existing coreset selection methods, designed for LLM
benchmarking, are unsuitable for prompt optimization due to challenges in
clustering similar samples, high data collection costs, and the unavailability
of performance data for new or private datasets. To overcome these issues, we
propose IPOMP, an Iterative evaluation data selection for effective Prompt
Optimization using real-time Model Performance. IPOMP is a two-stage approach
that selects representative and diverse samples using semantic clustering and
boundary analysis, followed by iterative refinement with real-time model
performance data to replace redundant samples. Evaluations on the BIG-bench
dataset show that IPOMP improves effectiveness by 1.6% to 5.3% and stability by
at least 57% compared with SOTA baselines, with minimal computational overhead
below 1%. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that our real-time
performance-guided refinement approach can be universally applied to enhance
existing coreset selection methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SemEval 2025中多语言声明检索共享任务，旨在解决多语言和低资源语言环境下的虚假信息问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线虚假信息的快速传播是一个全球性挑战，但多语言和低资源语言常被忽视。

Method: 设计了单语言和跨语言两个子任务，吸引了179名参与者，52份测试提交。

Result: 报告了最佳系统及常见有效方法，为多语言声明检索和自动事实核查提供见解。

Conclusion: 共享任务及其数据集和系统为未来研究提供了支持。

Abstract: The rapid spread of online disinformation presents a global challenge, and
machine learning has been widely explored as a potential solution. However,
multilingual settings and low-resource languages are often neglected in this
field. To address this gap, we conducted a shared task on multilingual claim
retrieval at SemEval 2025, aimed at identifying fact-checked claims that match
newly encountered claims expressed in social media posts across different
languages. The task includes two subtracks: (1) a monolingual track, where
social posts and claims are in the same language, and (2) a crosslingual track,
where social posts and claims might be in different languages. A total of 179
participants registered for the task contributing to 52 test submissions. 23
out of 31 teams have submitted their system papers. In this paper, we report
the best-performing systems as well as the most common and the most effective
approaches across both subtracks. This shared task, along with its dataset and
participating systems, provides valuable insights into multilingual claim
retrieval and automated fact-checking, supporting future research in this
field.

### [8] [Ranked Voting based Self-Consistency of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10772)
*Weiqin Wang,Yile Wang,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过生成排名答案并使用排名投票方法（如即时决选投票、波达计数投票和平均倒数排名投票）来提高链式思维推理可靠性的方法，实验证明其优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有链式思维推理方法通常只生成单一答案，忽略了其他潜在答案的可能性，导致投票过程中信息不足。

Method: 在每次推理过程中生成排名答案，并使用三种排名投票方法（即时决选投票、波达计数投票和平均倒数排名投票）进行投票。

Result: 在六个数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于基线方法，验证了排名答案信息和排名投票对提升推理性能的潜力。

Conclusion: 通过利用排名答案信息和排名投票方法，可以有效提高链式思维推理的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: Majority voting is considered an effective method to enhance chain-of-thought
reasoning, as it selects the answer with the highest "self-consistency" among
different reasoning paths (Wang et al., 2023). However, previous
chain-of-thought reasoning methods typically generate only a single answer in
each trial, thereby ignoring the possibility of other potential answers. As a
result, these alternative answers are often overlooked in subsequent voting
processes. In this work, we propose to generate ranked answers in each
reasoning process and conduct ranked voting among multiple ranked answers from
different responses, thereby making the overall self-consistency more reliable.
Specifically, we use three ranked voting methods: Instant-runoff voting, Borda
count voting, and mean reciprocal rank voting. We validate our methods on six
datasets, including three multiple-choice and three open-ended
question-answering tasks, using both advanced open-source and closed-source
large language models. Extensive experimental results indicate that our
proposed method outperforms the baselines, showcasing the potential of
leveraging the information of ranked answers and using ranked voting to improve
reasoning performance. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究分析了基础模型选择对奖励建模性能的影响，性能可提升14%，并展示了现有基准与下游性能的强统计关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展，选择合适的基础模型对奖励建模（RM）性能的影响常被忽视，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 系统分析了基础模型选择对奖励建模性能的影响，结合小规模基准数据提升模型选择效果，并探索后训练步骤和数据分布估计的影响。

Result: 性能提升达14%，结合基准数据可平均提升18%，后训练步骤和数据分布估计对性能预测误差有显著影响。

Conclusion: 基础模型选择对奖励建模性能至关重要，结合基准数据和优化后训练步骤可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and, at its core, reward
modeling have become a crucial part of training powerful large language models
(LLMs). One commonly overlooked factor in training high-quality reward models
(RMs) is the effect of the base model, which is becoming more challenging to
choose given the rapidly growing pool of LLMs. In this work, we present a
systematic analysis of the effect of base model selection on reward modeling
performance. Our results show that the performance can be improved by up to 14%
compared to the most common (i.e., default) choice. Moreover, we showcase the
strong statistical relation between some existing benchmarks and downstream
performances. We also demonstrate that the results from a small set of
benchmarks could be combined to boost the model selection ($+$18% on average in
the top 5-10). Lastly, we illustrate the impact of different post-training
steps on the final performance and explore using estimated data distributions
to reduce performance prediction error.

*Zhan Peng Lee,Andre Lin,Calvin Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Finetune-RAG通过微调方法提升RAG框架的事实准确性，并引入Bench-RAG评估管道。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG框架中因检索不完美导致LLM输出幻觉的问题。

Method: 构建模拟真实世界缺陷的RAG训练数据集，并提出Finetune-RAG微调方法。

Result: Finetune-RAG比基础模型的事实准确性提高了21.2%。

Conclusion: Finetune-RAG和Bench-RAG为RAG框架提供了有效的改进和评估工具，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to
improve factuality in large language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs
in retrieved documents. However, ensuring perfect retrieval of relevant
information remains challenging, and when irrelevant content is passed
downstream to an LLM, it can lead to hallucinations. In this work, we propose
Finetune-RAG, a simple and effective fine-tuning approach that features the
first-of-its-kind RAG training dataset constructed to mimic real-world
imperfections. Experimental results show that Finetune-RAG improves factual
accuracy by 21.2% over the base model. We also propose a Bench-RAG, an
LLM-as-a-judge evaluation pipeline that stress tests models under realistic
imperfect retrieval scenarios. Our codebase and dataset are fully open sourced
for community use.

### [11] [Relation Extraction Across Entire Books to Reconstruct Community Networks: The AffilKG Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10798)
*Erica Cai,Sean McQuade,Kevin Young,Brendan O'Connor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AffilKG是一个包含六个数据集的集合，首次将完整书籍扫描与大型标记知识图谱配对，用于评估知识图谱提取的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前标注的数据集无法评估从文本自动提取的知识图谱的准确性，因为它们高度不连通、规模过小或过于复杂。

Method: 引入AffilKG数据集，包含六个数据集，其中三个数据集扩展了更多关系类型。

Result: 初步实验显示模型性能在不同数据集上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: AffilKG能够支持两项关键进展：评估提取错误如何影响图级分析，以及验证知识图谱提取方法在社会科学研究中的实用性。

Abstract: When knowledge graphs (KGs) are automatically extracted from text, are they
accurate enough for downstream analysis? Unfortunately, current annotated
datasets can not be used to evaluate this question, since their KGs are highly
disconnected, too small, or overly complex. To address this gap, we introduce
AffilKG (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15427977), which is a collection of six
datasets that are the first to pair complete book scans with large, labeled
knowledge graphs. Each dataset features affiliation graphs, which are simple
KGs that capture Member relationships between Person and Organization entities
-- useful in studies of migration, community interactions, and other social
phenomena. In addition, three datasets include expanded KGs with a wider
variety of relation types. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate significant
variability in model performance across datasets, underscoring AffilKG's
ability to enable two critical advances: (1) benchmarking how extraction errors
propagate to graph-level analyses (e.g., community structure), and (2)
validating KG extraction methods for real-world social science research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如客家话）翻译中的词汇覆盖和语法连贯性问题，同时支持文化保护。

Method: 测试了不同模型配置，包括字典、RAG与Gemini 2.0结合，以及两阶段方法（字典输出后Gemini 2.0修正）。

Result: 最佳模型BLEU分数达31%，两阶段方法为26%，字典方法仅12%，显示RAG和迭代修正的优势。

Conclusion: 需结合领域知识、本地社区合作及文化保护，提升翻译准确性和流畅性。

Abstract: This study investigates the challenges of translating low-resource languages
by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG). Various model configurations were tested on Hakka translations, with
BLEU scores ranging from 12% (dictionary-only) to 31% (RAG with Gemini 2.0).
The best-performing model (Model 4) combined retrieval and advanced language
modeling, improving lexical coverage, particularly for specialized or
culturally nuanced terms, and enhancing grammatical coherence. A two-stage
method (Model 3) using dictionary outputs refined by Gemini 2.0 achieved a BLEU
score of 26%, highlighting iterative correction's value and the challenges of
domain-specific expressions. Static dictionary-based approaches struggled with
context-sensitive content, demonstrating the limitations of relying solely on
predefined resources. These results emphasize the need for curated resources,
domain knowledge, and ethical collaboration with local communities, offering a
framework that improves translation accuracy and fluency while supporting
cultural preservation.

TL;DR: AutoThink通过多阶段强化学习框架，动态调整大型推理模型的显式推理行为，以平衡准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型推理模型在简单问题上过度推理导致的计算开销和延迟问题。

Method: 基于R1风格蒸馏模型，利用省略号触发不同推理模式，并通过多阶段强化学习优化推理策略。

Result: 在五个主流数学基准测试中，AutoThink在准确性和效率上优于现有方法，显著减少令牌使用并提高准确性。

Conclusion: AutoThink为大型推理模型提供了一种可扩展且自适应的推理范式。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) are proficient at generating explicit,
step-by-step reasoning sequences before producing final answers. However, such
detailed reasoning can introduce substantial computational overhead and
latency, particularly for simple problems. To address this over-thinking
problem, we explore how to equip LRMs with adaptive thinking capabilities:
enabling them to dynamically decide whether or not to engage in explicit
reasoning based on problem complexity. Building on R1-style distilled models,
we observe that inserting a simple ellipsis ("...") into the prompt can
stochastically trigger either a thinking or no-thinking mode, revealing a
latent controllability in the reasoning behavior. Leveraging this property, we
propose AutoThink, a multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL) framework that
progressively optimizes reasoning policies via stage-wise reward shaping.
AutoThink learns to invoke explicit reasoning only when necessary, while
defaulting to succinct responses for simpler tasks. Experiments on five
mainstream mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoThink achieves
favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to recent prompting and
RL-based pruning methods. It can be seamlessly integrated into any R1-style
model, including both distilled and further fine-tuned variants. Notably,
AutoThink improves relative accuracy by 6.4 percent while reducing token usage
by 52 percent on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, establishing a scalable and
adaptive reasoning paradigm for LRMs.

TL;DR: 研究社交媒体事件检测的挑战，比较单模态、多模态和生成模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模态系统难以应对社交媒体数据的快速和多模态传播特性。

Method: 使用单模态模型（如ModernBERT、ConvNeXt-V2）、多模态融合技术和生成模型（如GPT-4o、LLaVA），并测试生成模型在单模态输入下的表现。

Result: 多模态方法显著优于单模态方法，但生成模型在精度上落后于监督方法，且难以正确生成事件类别。生成模型能有效处理社交媒体常见问题（如leet speak）。

Conclusion: 多模态方法在事件检测中表现最佳，但生成模型在特定问题上具有潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the challenges of detecting events on social media,
where traditional unimodal systems struggle due to the rapid and multimodal
nature of data dissemination. We employ a range of models, including unimodal
ModernBERT and ConvNeXt-V2, multimodal fusion techniques, and advanced
generative models like GPT-4o, and LLaVA. Additionally, we also study the
effect of providing multimodal generative models (such as GPT-4o) with a single
modality to assess their efficacy. Our results indicate that while multimodal
approaches notably outperform unimodal counterparts, generative approaches
despite having a large number of parameters, lag behind supervised methods in
precision. Furthermore, we also found that they lag behind instruction-tuned
models because of their inability to generate event classes correctly. During
our error analysis, we discovered that common social media issues such as leet
speak, text elongation, etc. are effectively handled by generative approaches
but are hard to tackle using supervised approaches.

Motivation: 研究MLLMs在识别模拟时钟时间上的失败原因，并测试其是否具备抽象和泛化能力。

Method: 使用GPT-4.1进行实验，分析其识别时钟时间的能力，并通过不同时钟测试其泛化性。

Result: 模型在识别时钟时间上有所进步，但可能仅依赖训练数据模式而非真正理解。

Conclusion: MLLMs在抽象和泛化能力上仍有局限，需进一步研究以提升其实际应用能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models which can answer complex questions on an
image struggle to tell the time on analog clocks. This is probably due to the
lack of images with clocks at different times in their training set. In this
work we explore this issue with one of the latest MLLMs: GPT-4.1 to understand
why MLLMs fail to tell the time and whether fine-tuning can solve the problem.
The results show how models are making progress in reading the time on analog
clocks. But have they really learned to do it, or have they only learned
patterns in their training datasets? In this work we put the models to the test
with different clocks to illustrate the limitations of MLLMs to abstract and
generalize.

### [16] [Improve Rule Retrieval and Reasoning with Self-Induction and Relevance ReEstimate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10870)
*Ziyang Huang,Wangtao Sun,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SIAR的新方法，利用大语言模型（LLMs）从查询中归纳潜在推理规则，并通过规则相关性重估（R$^3$）提升检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 规则检索是一个重要但研究不足的领域，现有方法因查询事实与规则抽象表示之间的语义差距导致检索准确性低。

Method: 提出SIAR方法，利用LLMs归纳潜在推理规则并用于查询增强；引入R$^3$方法重估规则相关性。

Result: 实验表明，所提方法在多种设置下均有效且通用。

Conclusion: SIAR和R$^3$显著提升了规则检索的准确性和推理性能。

Abstract: This paper systematically addresses the challenges of rule retrieval, a
crucial yet underexplored area. Vanilla retrieval methods using sparse or dense
retrievers to directly search for relevant rules to support downstream
reasoning, often suffer from low accuracy. This is primarily due to a
significant semantic gap between the instantiated facts in the queries and the
abstract representations of the rules. Such misalignment results in suboptimal
retrieval quality, which in turn negatively impacts reasoning performance. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Self-Induction Augmented Retrieval
(SIAR), a novel approach that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to induce
potential inferential rules that might offer benefits for reasoning by
abstracting the underlying knowledge and logical structure in queries. These
induced rules are then used for query augmentation to improve retrieval
effectiveness. Additionally, we introduce Rule Relevance ReEstimate (R$^3$), a
method that re-estimates the relevance of retrieved rules by assessing whether
the abstract knowledge they contain can be instantiated to align with the facts
in the queries and the helpfulness for reasoning. Extensive experiments across
various settings demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our proposed
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CUAs能力的提升，其安全风险日益突出，需系统化研究以应对复杂的安全挑战。

Method: 通过文献综述，围绕四个目标展开：定义CUAs、分类威胁、提出防御策略、总结评估基准。

Result: 构建了CUAs安全研究的结构化基础，为未来研究提供方向，并为实践提供指导。

Conclusion: 论文为CUAs的安全研究奠定了基础，帮助探索未发现的漏洞并指导安全设计。

Abstract: Recently, AI-driven interactions with computing devices have advanced from
basic prototype tools to sophisticated, LLM-based systems that emulate
human-like operations in graphical user interfaces. We are now witnessing the
emergence of \emph{Computer-Using Agents} (CUAs), capable of autonomously
performing tasks such as navigating desktop applications, web pages, and mobile
apps. However, as these agents grow in capability, they also introduce novel
safety and security risks. Vulnerabilities in LLM-driven reasoning, with the
added complexity of integrating multiple software components and multimodal
inputs, further complicate the security landscape. In this paper, we present a
systematization of knowledge on the safety and security threats of CUAs. We
conduct a comprehensive literature review and distill our findings along four
research objectives: \textit{\textbf{(i)}} define the CUA that suits safety
analysis; \textit{\textbf{(ii)} } categorize current safety threats among CUAs;
\textit{\textbf{(iii)}} propose a comprehensive taxonomy of existing defensive
strategies; \textit{\textbf{(iv)}} summarize prevailing benchmarks, datasets,
and evaluation metrics used to assess the safety and performance of CUAs.
Building on these insights, our work provides future researchers with a
structured foundation for exploring unexplored vulnerabilities and offers
practitioners actionable guidance in designing and deploying secure
Computer-Using Agents.

TL;DR: Cochain是一个协作提示框架，通过结合知识和提示以低成本解决业务工作流协作问题，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单代理思维链和多代理系统在业务工作流任务中存在协作和成本问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 构建集成知识图并维护提示树，结合多阶段知识和提示信息。

Result: Cochain在多个数据集上表现优于基线方法，小模型结合Cochain甚至优于GPT-4。

Conclusion: Cochain为业务工作流协作提供了一种高效且低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in
executing complex reasoning tasks. Chain-of-thought effectively enhances
reasoning capabilities by unlocking the potential of large models, while
multi-agent systems provide more comprehensive solutions by integrating
collective intelligence of multiple agents. However, both approaches face
significant limitations. Single-agent with chain-of-thought, due to the
inherent complexity of designing cross-domain prompts, faces collaboration
challenges. Meanwhile, multi-agent systems consume substantial tokens and
inevitably dilute the primary problem, which is particularly problematic in
business workflow tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Cochain, a
collaboration prompting framework that effectively solves business workflow
collaboration problem by combining knowledge and prompts at a reduced cost.
Specifically, we construct an integrated knowledge graph that incorporates
knowledge from multiple stages. Furthermore, by maintaining and retrieving a
prompts tree, we can obtain prompt information relevant to other stages of the
business workflow. We perform extensive evaluations of Cochain across multiple
datasets, demonstrating that Cochain outperforms all baselines in both prompt
engineering and multi-agent LLMs. Additionally, expert evaluation results
indicate that the use of a small model in combination with Cochain outperforms
GPT-4.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了OmniThought数据集，解决了大型推理模型（LRMs）训练中缺乏全面链式思考（CoT）数据的问题，并通过新评分指标提升模型训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CoT数据集不足以支持LRMs的进一步发展，缺乏多教师模型生成的广泛推理问题及对CoT内部特性的描述。

Method: 提出OmniThought数据集，包含200万条由两个强大LRMs生成的CoT过程，并标注了新颖的推理冗长度（RV）和认知难度（CD）评分。

Result: 实验表明RV和CD评分显著提升了LRMs的训练效果，并基于OmniThought训练出高性能LRMs。

Conclusion: OmniThought数据集和评分指标显著推动了LRMs在复杂任务中的应用和发展。

Abstract: The emergence of large reasoning models (LRMs) has transformed Natural
Language Processing by excelling in complex tasks such as mathematical
problem-solving and code generation. These models leverage chain-of-thought
(CoT) processes, enabling them to emulate human-like reasoning strategies.
However, the advancement of LRMs is hindered by the lack of comprehensive CoT
datasets. Current resources often fail to provide extensive reasoning problems
with coherent CoT processes distilled from multiple teacher models and do not
account for multifaceted properties describing the internal characteristics of
CoTs. To address these challenges, we introduce OmniThought, a large-scale
dataset featuring 2 million CoT processes generated and validated by two
powerful LRMs as teacher models. Each CoT process in OmniThought is annotated
with novel Reasoning Verbosity (RV) and Cognitive Difficulty (CD) scores, which
describe the appropriateness of CoT verbosity and cognitive difficulty level
for models to comprehend these reasoning processes. We further establish a
self-reliant pipeline to curate this dataset. Extensive experiments using
Qwen2.5 models of various sizes demonstrate the positive impact of our proposed
scores on LRM training effectiveness. Based on the proposed OmniThought
dataset, we further train and release a series of high-performing LRMs,
specifically equipped with stronger reasoning abilities and optimal CoT output
length and difficulty level. Our contributions significantly enhance the
development and training of LRMs for solving complex tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KV Cache量化通过通道和令牌方式分别处理Keys和Values，但异常令牌会影响精度。本文提出一种方法识别并排除这些异常令牌，显著提升2-bit量化下的精度，同时减少内存占用和提高吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）部署时计算资源消耗大，KV Cache虽减少推理时的重计算，但增加内存开销。量化KV Cache可平衡内存和精度，但异常令牌的存在影响量化精度。

Method: 提出一种简单有效的方法，在解码过程中准确识别异常令牌并将其排除在量化之外。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在2-bit量化下显著提升精度，内存使用减少6.4倍，吞吐量提高2.3倍。

Conclusion: 通过识别并排除异常令牌，KV Cache量化在精度和效率上取得显著改进。

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) come at the cost
of substantial computational resources during deployment. While KV Cache can
significantly reduce recomputation during inference, it also introduces
additional memory overhead. KV Cache quantization presents a promising
solution, striking a good balance between memory usage and accuracy. Previous
research has shown that the Keys are distributed by channel, while the Values
are distributed by token. Consequently, the common practice is to apply
channel-wise quantization to the Keys and token-wise quantization to the
Values. However, our further investigation reveals that a small subset of
unusual tokens exhibit unique characteristics that deviate from this pattern,
which can substantially impact quantization accuracy. To address this, we
develop a simple yet effective method to identify these tokens accurately
during the decoding process and exclude them from quantization as outlier
tokens, significantly improving overall accuracy. Extensive experiments show
that our method achieves significant accuracy improvements under 2-bit
quantization and can deliver a 6.4 times reduction in memory usage and a 2.3
times increase in throughput.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种模块化框架GenKnowSub，通过分离通用知识和任务特定知识，提升大语言模型的零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在零样本泛化中通用知识与任务特定知识纠缠的问题。

Method: 构建任务特定LoRA模块库和通用域LoRA模块，通过通用知识减法（GenKnowSub）提取任务相关残差模块，结合Arrow路由算法动态选择模块。

Result: 在Phi-3和Phi-2模型上，多语言通用知识LoRA模块显著提升了单语言和跨语言任务的性能。

Conclusion: GenKnowSub方法有效提升模型零样本泛化能力，适用于不同强度的LLM。

Abstract: Large language models often struggle with zero-shot generalization, and
several modular approaches have been proposed to address this challenge. Yet,
we hypothesize that a key limitation remains: the entanglement of general
knowledge and task-specific adaptations. To overcome this, we propose a modular
framework that disentangles these components by constructing a library of
task-specific LoRA modules alongside a general-domain LoRA. By subtracting this
general knowledge component from each task-specific module, we obtain residual
modules that focus more exclusively on task-relevant information, a method we
call general knowledge subtraction (GenKnowSub). Leveraging the refined
task-specific modules and the Arrow routing algorithm
\citep{ostapenko2024towards}, we dynamically select and combine modules for new
inputs without additional training. Our studies on the Phi-3 model and standard
Arrow as baselines reveal that using general knowledge LoRAs derived from
diverse languages, including English, French, and German, yields consistent
performance gains in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings across a wide
set of benchmarks. Further experiments on Phi-2 demonstrate how GenKnowSub
generalizes to weaker LLMs. The complete code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在将多语言大型语言模型迁移到目标语言时，由于主要依赖英语数据训练的源模型，可能限制了目标语言的表达能力。

Method: SALT通过语义感知线性迁移技术，利用目标语言预训练模型的嵌入，为每个非重叠词汇生成独特的回归线。

Result: 实验表明，SALT在跨语言迁移中表现优异，损失更低且收敛更快，尤其在跨语言理解任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: SALT展示了预训练模型在增强当代大型语言模型功能方面的可扩展性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly incorporate multilingual
capabilities, fueling the demand to transfer them into target language-specific
models. However, most approaches, which blend the source model's embedding by
replacing the source vocabulary with the target language-specific vocabulary,
may constrain expressive capacity in the target language since the source model
is predominantly trained on English data. In this paper, we propose Semantic
Aware Linear Transfer (SALT), a novel cross-lingual transfer technique that
recycles embeddings from target language Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to
transmit the deep representational strengths of PLM-derived embedding to LLMs.
SALT derives unique regression lines based on the similarity in the overlap of
the source and target vocabularies, to handle each non-overlapping token's
embedding space. Our extensive experiments show that SALT significantly
outperforms other transfer methods and achieves lower loss with accelerating
faster convergence during language adaptation. Notably, SALT obtains remarkable
performance in cross-lingual understanding setups compared to other methods.
Furthermore, we highlight the scalable use of PLMs to enhance the functionality
of contemporary LLMs by conducting experiments with varying architectures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), inspired by neuroscience, exhibit behaviors

Result: 通过比较标准基准测试，论文总结了不同方法的性能表现。

Conclusion: 论文提出了构建鲁棒且可扩展的多说话人ASR的开放挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Monaural multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains challenging
due to data scarcity and the intrinsic difficulty of recognizing and
attributing words to individual speakers, particularly in overlapping speech.
Recent advances have driven the shift from cascade systems to end-to-end (E2E)
architectures, which reduce error propagation and better exploit the synergy
between speech content and speaker identity. Despite rapid progress in E2E
multi-speaker ASR, the field lacks a comprehensive review of recent
developments. This survey provides a systematic taxonomy of E2E neural
approaches for multi-speaker ASR, highlighting recent advances and comparative
analysis. Specifically, we analyze: (1) architectural paradigms (SIMO vs.~SISO)
for pre-segmented audio, analyzing their distinct characteristics and
trade-offs; (2) recent architectural and algorithmic improvements based on
these two paradigms; (3) extensions to long-form speech, including segmentation
strategy and speaker-consistent hypothesis stitching. Further, we (4) evaluate
and compare methods across standard benchmarks. We conclude with a discussion
of open challenges and future research directions towards building robust and
scalable multi-speaker ASR.

Method: 利用Pythia扩展套件和中间检查点，系统研究ICL在下游任务的表现，并对残差流的子空间进行机制分析。

Result: ICL超越了简单的数据记忆，但未形成独立的符号算法，同时揭示了训练动态、模型能力和机制可解释性的影响。

Conclusion: 研究推进了对ICL的理解，为模型改进和AI安全提供了依据。

Abstract: Large-scale Transformer language models (LMs) trained solely on next-token
prediction with web-scale data can solve a wide range of tasks after seeing
just a few examples. The mechanism behind this capability, known as in-context
learning (ICL), remains both controversial and poorly understood. Some studies
argue that it is merely the result of memorizing vast amounts of data, while
others contend that it reflects a fundamental, symbolic algorithmic development
in LMs. In this work, we introduce a suite of investigative tasks and a novel
method to systematically investigate ICL by leveraging the full Pythia scaling
suite, including interim checkpoints that capture progressively larger amount
of training data. By carefully exploring ICL performance on downstream tasks
and simultaneously conducting a mechanistic analysis of the residual stream's
subspace, we demonstrate that ICL extends beyond mere "memorization" of the
training corpus, yet does not amount to the implementation of an independent
symbolic algorithm. Our results also clarify several aspects of ICL, including
the influence of training dynamics, model capabilities, and elements of
mechanistic interpretability. Overall, our work advances the understanding of
ICL and its implications, offering model developers insights into potential
improvements and providing AI security practitioners with a basis for more
informed guidelines.

Method: 使用Transformer模型，从不同不完整输入类型（如辅音序列、元音序列、部分音节等）重建完整音节序列。

Result: 辅音序列在预测中表现优异，元音序列更具挑战性，模型在部分和掩码音节重建任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: 研究推进了对Abugida语言序列预测的理解，并为相关应用提供了实用见解。

Abstract: This paper explores syllable sequence prediction in Abugida languages using
Transformer-based models, focusing on six languages: Bengali, Hindi, Khmer,
Lao, Myanmar, and Thai, from the Asian Language Treebank (ALT) dataset. We
investigate the reconstruction of complete syllable sequences from various
incomplete input types, including consonant sequences, vowel sequences, partial
syllables (with random character deletions), and masked syllables (with fixed
syllable deletions). Our experiments reveal that consonant sequences play a
critical role in accurate syllable prediction, achieving high BLEU scores,
while vowel sequences present a significantly greater challenge. The model
demonstrates robust performance across tasks, particularly in handling partial
and masked syllable reconstruction, with strong results for tasks involving
consonant information and syllable masking. This study advances the
understanding of sequence prediction for Abugida languages and provides
practical insights for applications such as text prediction, spelling
correction, and data augmentation in these scripts.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在多轮对话数据生成中难以平衡多样性与质量的问题。

Result: 在MMLU-Pro和MT-Bench上分别取得2.9%和2%的绝对提升，验证了框架有效性。

Conclusion: 多代理评审框架能规模化生成高质量对话数据，提升LLM性能。

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in conversational AI is
hindered by their reliance on single-turn supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data,
which limits contextual coherence in multi-turn dialogues. Existing methods for
generating multi-turn dialogue data struggle to ensure both diversity and
quality in instructions. To address this, we propose Review-Instruct, a novel
framework that synthesizes multi-turn conversations through an iterative
"Ask-Respond-Review" process involving three agent roles: a Candidate, multiple
Reviewers, and a Chairman. The framework iteratively refines instructions by
incorporating Reviewer feedback, enhancing dialogue diversity and difficulty.
We construct a multi-turn dataset using the Alpaca dataset and fine-tune the
LLaMA2-13B model. Evaluations on MT-Bench, MMLU-Pro, and Auto-Arena demonstrate
significant improvements, achieving absolute gains of 2.9\% on MMLU-Pro and 2\%
on MT-Bench compared to prior state-of-the-art models based on LLaMA2-13B.
Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the Review stage and the use of
multiple Reviewers in boosting instruction diversity and difficulty. Our work
highlights the potential of review-driven, multi-agent frameworks for
generating high-quality conversational data at scale.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但其处理结构化符号知识的能力尚未充分探索，因此需要系统评估。

Method: 提出OntoURL基准，基于分类法评估LLMs在本体知识中的理解、推理和学习能力，涵盖15个任务和58,981个问题。

Result: 实验显示，LLMs在本体理解上表现良好，但在推理和学习任务中存在显著弱点，不同模型和领域间性能差异明显。

Conclusion: OntoURL为LLMs与形式化知识表示的集成提供了关键基准，揭示了LLMs处理符号知识的根本局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a range of natural language processing tasks, yet their ability to process
structured symbolic knowledge remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
propose a taxonomy of LLMs' ontological capabilities and introduce OntoURL, the
first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs'
proficiency in handling ontologies -- formal, symbolic representations of
domain knowledge through concepts, relationships, and instances. Based on the
proposed taxonomy, OntoURL systematically assesses three dimensions:
understanding, reasoning, and learning through 15 distinct tasks comprising
58,981 questions derived from 40 ontologies across 8 domains. Experiments with
20 open-source LLMs reveal significant performance differences across models,
tasks, and domains, with current LLMs showing proficiency in understanding
ontological knowledge but substantial weaknesses in reasoning and learning
tasks. These findings highlight fundamental limitations in LLMs' capability to
process symbolic knowledge and establish OntoURL as a critical benchmark for
advancing the integration of LLMs with formal knowledge representations.

Abstract: Reward models are central to aligning LLMs with human preferences, but they
are costly to train, requiring large-scale human-labeled preference data and
powerful pretrained LLM backbones. Meanwhile, the increasing availability of
high-quality synthetic instruction-following datasets raises the question: can
simpler, reference-based metrics serve as viable alternatives to reward models
during RL-based alignment? In this paper, we show first that BLEU, a basic
string-matching metric, surprisingly matches strong reward models in agreement
with human preferences on general instruction-following datasets. Based on this
insight, we develop BLEUBERI, a method that first identifies challenging
instructions and then applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using
BLEU directly as the reward function. We demonstrate that BLEUBERI-trained
models are competitive with models trained via reward model-guided RL across
four challenging instruction-following benchmarks and three different base
language models. A human evaluation further supports that the quality of
BLEUBERI model outputs is on par with those from reward model-aligned models.
Moreover, BLEUBERI models generate outputs that are more factually grounded
than competing methods. Overall, we show that given access to high-quality
reference outputs (easily obtained via existing instruction-following datasets
or synthetic data generation), string matching-based metrics are cheap yet
effective proxies for reward models during alignment. We release our code and
data at https://github.com/lilakk/BLEUBERI.

Motivation: 专利权利要求起草复杂且耗时，现有自动生成方法评估与人工评估不一致，需更准确的评估标准。

Method: 引入Patent-CE基准和PatClaimEval评估方法，基于五项关键标准进行多维度评估。

Result: PatClaimEval在所有评估标准中与人工评估相关性最高。

Conclusion: 研究为专利权利要求自动生成系统的准确评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: Patent claims define the scope of protection and establish the legal
boundaries of an invention. Drafting these claims is a complex and
time-consuming process that usually requires the expertise of skilled patent
attorneys, which can form a large access barrier for many small enterprises. To
solve these challenges, researchers have investigated the use of large language
models (LLMs) for automating patent claim generation. However, existing studies
highlight inconsistencies between automated evaluation metrics and human expert
assessments. To bridge this gap, we introduce Patent-CE, the first
comprehensive benchmark for evaluating patent claims. Patent-CE includes
comparative claim evaluations annotated by patent experts, focusing on five key
criteria: feature completeness, conceptual clarity, terminology consistency,
logical linkage, and overall quality. Additionally, we propose PatClaimEval, a
novel multi-dimensional evaluation method specifically designed for patent
claims. Our experiments demonstrate that PatClaimEval achieves the highest
correlation with human expert evaluations across all assessment criteria among
all tested metrics. This research provides the groundwork for more accurate
evaluations of automated patent claim generation systems.

TL;DR: 研究表明，通过增加推理链长度和计算资源，大型语言模型（LLM）在数学推理任务中表现提升，但在开放领域问答（QA）中的事实准确性效果尚不明确。本文通过实验验证了推理链对事实准确性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨推理链长度是否能在开放领域QA任务中提升事实准确性，并验证测试时计算资源的作用。

Method: 从大型推理模型（QwQ-32B和DeepSeek-R1-671B）中提取推理轨迹，结合知识图谱信息，微调多种模型（从小型到大型架构），并进行168次实验。

Result: 在单次运行中，小型推理模型的事实准确性显著提升；增加测试时计算和标记预算可进一步提高准确性2-8%。

Conclusion: 测试时扩展计算资源能有效提升开放领域QA任务中的推理准确性，相关实验数据已公开。

Abstract: Recent studies on large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities have
demonstrated promising improvements in model performance by leveraging a
lengthy thinking process and additional computational resources during
inference, primarily in tasks involving mathematical reasoning (Muennighoff et
al., 2025). However, it remains uncertain if longer reasoning chains inherently
enhance factual accuracy, particularly beyond mathematical contexts. In this
work, we thoroughly examine LLM reasoning within complex open-domain
question-answering (QA) scenarios. We initially distill reasoning traces from
advanced, large-scale reasoning models (QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1-671B), then
fine-tune a variety of models ranging from smaller, instruction-tuned variants
to larger architectures based on Qwen2.5. To enrich reasoning traces, we
introduce factual information from knowledge graphs in the form of paths into
our reasoning traces. Our experimental setup includes four baseline approaches
and six different instruction-tuned models evaluated across a benchmark of six
datasets, encompassing over 22.6K questions. Overall, we carry out 168
experimental runs and analyze approximately 1.7 million reasoning traces. Our
findings indicate that, within a single run, smaller reasoning models achieve
noticeable improvements in factual accuracy compared to their original
instruction-tuned counterparts. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that adding
test-time compute and token budgets factual accuracy consistently improves by
2-8%, further confirming the effectiveness of test-time scaling for enhancing
performance and consequently improving reasoning accuracy in open-domain QA
tasks. We release all the experimental artifacts for further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在长上下文任务中表现不佳，主要因数据质量、训练效率及优化目标不足。

Method: SoLoPO框架分为短上下文偏好优化（PO）和短到长奖励对齐（SoLo-RA），提升模型能力。

Result: 实验显示SoLoPO显著提升模型在长上下文任务中的泛化能力和效率。

Conclusion: SoLoPO有效解决长上下文对齐问题，兼容主流优化算法，提升训练效率。

Abstract: Despite advances in pretraining with extended context lengths, large language
models (LLMs) still face challenges in effectively utilizing real-world
long-context information, primarily due to insufficient long-context alignment
caused by data quality issues, training inefficiencies, and the lack of
well-designed optimization objectives. To address these limitations, we propose
a framework named $\textbf{S}$h$\textbf{o}$rt-to-$\textbf{Lo}$ng
$\textbf{P}$reference $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{SoLoPO}$), decoupling
long-context preference optimization (PO) into two components: short-context PO
and short-to-long reward alignment (SoLo-RA), supported by both theoretical and
empirical evidence. Specifically, short-context PO leverages preference pairs
sampled from short contexts to enhance the model's contextual knowledge
utilization ability. Meanwhile, SoLo-RA explicitly encourages reward score
consistency utilization for the responses when conditioned on both short and
long contexts that contain identical task-relevant information. This
facilitates transferring the model's ability to handle short contexts into
long-context scenarios. SoLoPO is compatible with mainstream preference
optimization algorithms, while substantially improving the efficiency of data
construction and training processes. Experimental results show that SoLoPO
enhances all these algorithms with respect to stronger length and domain
generalization abilities across various long-context benchmarks, while
achieving notable improvements in both computational and memory efficiency.

Motivation: 研究无位置编码的Transformer在平均硬注意力机制下的表达能力，揭示其与半代数集的对应关系。

Method: 通过理论分析，证明NoPE-AHATs（平均硬注意力NoPE-Transformer）能表达非负整数解的多变量多项式方程（Diophantine方程）对应的语言。

Result: NoPE-AHATs能表达半代数集，但无法表达简单的PARITY计数性质，且其分析问题是不可判定的。

Conclusion: NoPE-transformers在平均硬注意力下具有强大的表达能力，但其复杂性限制了实际应用中的可分析性。

Abstract: Positional Encodings (PEs) seem to be indispensable for ensuring
expressiveness of transformers; without them attention transformers reduce to a
bag-of-word model. NoPE-transformers (i.e. with No PEs) with unique hard
attention mechanisms were very recently shown to only be able to express
regular languages, i.e., with limited counting ability. This paper shows that,
with average hard attention mechanisms, NoPE-transformers are still
surprisingly expressive: they can express counting languages corresponding to
nonnegative integer solutions to multivariate polynomial equations (i.e.
Diophantine equations), reasoning about which is well-known to be undecidable.
In fact, we provide a precise characterization of languages expressible by
Average Hard Attention NoPE-Transformers (NoPE-AHATs): they correspond
precisely to what we call \emph{semi-algebraic sets}, i.e., finite unions of
sets of nonnegative integer solutions to systems of multivariate polynomial
inequations. We obtain several interesting consequences of our
characterization. Firstly, NoPE-transformers can express counting properties
that are far more complex than established models like simplified counter
machines and Petri nets, but cannot express a very simple counting property of
PARITY. Secondly, the problem of analyzing NoPE-transformers is undecidable,
e.g., whether a given NoPE transformer classifies all input strings in one
class. To complement our results, we exhibit a counting language that is not
expressible by average hard attention transformers even with arbitrary PEs but
is expressible in the circuit complexity class TC$^0$, answering an open
problem.

*Chengyu Huang,Zhengxin Zhang,Claire Cardie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HAPO（历史感知策略优化）通过记录历史状态和设计长度奖励函数，优化LLMs的推理能力，减少输出长度同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未利用训练中同一问题的历史信息，限制了解决方案的简洁性。HAPO旨在通过历史状态优化，逐步生成更简洁的解决方案。

Method: HAPO记录历史状态（如最小正确响应长度），设计长度奖励函数激励更简洁的正确解决方案，同时避免惩罚短错误响应。

Result: 实验表明，HAPO在多个数学基准测试中实现33-59%的长度缩减，准确性仅下降2-5%。

Conclusion: HAPO有效提升LLMs的简洁推理能力，平衡了正确性与效率。

Abstract: While scaling the length of responses at test-time has been shown to markedly
improve the reasoning abilities and performance of large language models
(LLMs), it often results in verbose outputs and increases inference cost. Prior
approaches for efficient test-time scaling, typically using universal budget
constraints or query-level length optimization, do not leverage historical
information from previous encounters with the same problem during training. We
hypothesize that this limits their ability to progressively make solutions more
concise over time. To address this, we present History-Aware Policy
Optimization (HAPO), which keeps track of a history state (e.g., the minimum
length over previously generated correct responses) for each problem. HAPO
employs a novel length reward function based on this history state to
incentivize the discovery of correct solutions that are more concise than those
previously found. Crucially, this reward structure avoids overly penalizing
shorter incorrect responses with the goal of facilitating exploration towards
more efficient solutions. By combining this length reward with a correctness
reward, HAPO jointly optimizes for correctness and efficiency. We use HAPO to
train DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview, and
Qwen-2.5-1.5B-Instruct, and evaluate HAPO on several math benchmarks that span
various difficulty levels. Experiment results demonstrate that HAPO effectively
induces LLMs' concise reasoning abilities, producing length reductions of
33-59% with accuracy drops of only 2-5%.

Result: 在单跳和多跳QA基准测试中表现优异，尤其在复杂推理场景中。

Conclusion: AutoRefine通过高质量搜索和证据合成，显著提升了推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities but
are inherently limited by their knowledge reservoir. Retrieval-augmented
reasoning mitigates this limitation by allowing LLMs to query external
resources, but existing methods often retrieve irrelevant or noisy information,
hindering accurate reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoRefine, a
reinforcement learning post-training framework that adopts a new
``search-and-refine-during-think'' paradigm. AutoRefine introduces explicit
knowledge refinement steps between successive search calls, enabling the model
to iteratively filter, distill, and organize evidence before generating an
answer. Furthermore, we incorporate tailored retrieval-specific rewards
alongside answer correctness rewards using group relative policy optimization.
Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that
AutoRefine significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in
complex, multi-hop reasoning scenarios. Detailed analysis shows that AutoRefine
issues frequent, higher-quality searches and synthesizes evidence effectively.

Motivation: 早期风险检测（ERD）需要快速准确地识别面临社会和健康问题的用户，但传统分类指标可能不足以满足需求，尤其是涉及延迟和精度的权衡时。

Method: 采用时间微调策略，显式地将时间纳入学习过程，分析用户的完整发帖历史，并在不同上下文中调整模型。

Conclusion: 通过时间微调，可以结合精度和速度作为单一目标，有效解决ERD问题。

Abstract: Early Risk Detection (ERD) on the Web aims to identify promptly users facing
social and health issues. Users are analyzed post-by-post, and it is necessary
to guarantee correct and quick answers, which is particularly challenging in
critical scenarios. ERD involves optimizing classification precision and
minimizing detection delay. Standard classification metrics may not suffice,
resorting to specific metrics such as ERDE(theta) that explicitly consider
precision and delay. The current research focuses on applying a multi-objective
approach, prioritizing classification performance and establishing a separate
criterion for decision time. In this work, we propose a completely different
strategy, temporal fine-tuning, which allows tuning transformer-based models by
explicitly incorporating time within the learning process. Our method allows us
to analyze complete user post histories, tune models considering different
contexts, and evaluate training performance using temporal metrics. We
evaluated our proposal in the depression and eating disorders tasks for the
Spanish language, achieving competitive results compared to the best models of
MentalRiskES 2023. We found that temporal fine-tuning optimized decisions
considering context and time progress. In this way, by properly taking
advantage of the power of transformers, it is possible to address ERD by
combining precision and speed as a single objective.

Abstract: Effective communication about breast and cervical cancers remains a
persistent health challenge, with significant gaps in public understanding of
cancer prevention, screening, and treatment, potentially leading to delayed
diagnoses and inadequate treatments. This study evaluates the capabilities and
limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate, safe, and
accessible cancer-related information to support patient understanding. We
evaluated five general-purpose and three medical LLMs using a mixed-methods
evaluation framework across linguistic quality, safety and trustworthiness, and
communication accessibility and affectiveness. Our approach utilized
quantitative metrics, qualitative expert ratings, and statistical analysis
using Welch's ANOVA, Games-Howell, and Hedges' g. Our results show that
general-purpose LLMs produced outputs of higher linguistic quality and
affectiveness, while medical LLMs demonstrate greater communication
accessibility. However, medical LLMs tend to exhibit higher levels of potential
harm, toxicity, and bias, reducing their performance in safety and
trustworthiness. Our findings indicate a duality between domain-specific
knowledge and safety in health communications. The results highlight the need
for intentional model design with targeted improvements, particularly in
mitigating harm and bias, and improving safety and affectiveness. This study
provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for cancer communication, offering
critical insights for improving AI-generated health content and informing
future development of accurate, safe, and accessible digital health tools.

Motivation: Transformer在形态变化任务中表现优异，但其跨语言和形态规则的泛化能力有限，可能与其对音位和次音位层面隐式现象的捕捉能力有关。

Method: 提出了一种语言无关的探测方法，研究了七种形态多样的语言中音位特征的编码情况，重点关注局部和长距离音位依赖关系。

Result: 局部音位特征（如土耳其语的末尾阻塞音清化）在音位嵌入中表现良好，而长距离依赖（如元音和谐）在Transformer编码器中表现更好。

Conclusion: 研究结果为训练形态模型的策略提供了实证依据，强调了次音位特征获取的重要性。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in morphological
inflection tasks, yet their ability to generalize across languages and
morphological rules remains limited. One possible explanation for this behavior
can be the degree to which these models are able to capture implicit phenomena
at the phonological and subphonemic levels. We introduce a language-agnostic
probing method to investigate phonological feature encoding in transformers
trained directly on phonemes, and perform it across seven morphologically
diverse languages. We show that phonological features which are local, such as
final-obstruent devoicing in Turkish, are captured well in phoneme embeddings,
whereas long-distance dependencies like vowel harmony are better represented in
the transformer's encoder. Finally, we discuss how these findings inform
empirical strategies for training morphological models, particularly regarding
the role of subphonemic feature acquisition.

Conclusion: XtraGPT为科学写作提供了有效的上下文感知和指令引导支持，填补了现有LLM的不足。

Abstract: Despite the growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in academic
workflows, their capabilities remain limited when it comes to supporting
high-quality scientific writing. Most existing systems are designed for
general-purpose scientific text generation and fail to meet the sophisticated
demands of research communication beyond surface-level polishing, such as
conceptual coherence across sections. Furthermore, academic writing is
inherently iterative and revision-driven, a process not well supported by
direct prompting-based paradigms. To address these scenarios, we propose a
human-AI collaboration framework for academic paper revision. We first
introduce a comprehensive dataset of 7,040 research papers from top-tier venues
annotated with over 140,000 instruction-response pairs that reflect realistic,
section-level scientific revisions. Building on the dataset, we develop
XtraGPT, the first suite of open-source LLMs, designed to provide
context-aware, instruction-guided writing assistance, ranging from 1.5B to 14B
parameters. Extensive experiments validate that XtraGPT significantly
outperforms same-scale baselines and approaches the quality of proprietary
systems. Both automated preference assessments and human evaluations confirm
the effectiveness of our models in improving scientific drafts.

Conclusion: LegoSLM有效结合语音编码器和LLM，性能显著提升且灵活性强。

Abstract: Recently, large-scale pre-trained speech encoders and Large Language Models
(LLMs) have been released, which show state-of-the-art performance on a range
of spoken language processing tasks including Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR). To effectively combine both models for better performance, continuous
speech prompts, and ASR error correction have been adopted. However, these
methods are prone to suboptimal performance or are inflexible. In this paper,
we propose a new paradigm, LegoSLM, that bridges speech encoders and LLMs using
the ASR posterior matrices. The speech encoder is trained to generate
Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) posteriors over the LLM vocabulary,
which are used to reconstruct pseudo-audio embeddings by computing a weighted
sum of the LLM input embeddings. These embeddings are concatenated with text
embeddings in the LLM input space. Using the well-performing USM and Gemma
models as an example, we demonstrate that our proposed LegoSLM method yields
good performance on both ASR and speech translation tasks. By connecting USM
with Gemma models, we can get an average of 49% WERR over the USM-CTC baseline
on 8 MLS testsets. The trained model also exhibits modularity in a range of
settings -- after fine-tuning the Gemma model weights, the speech encoder can
be switched and combined with the LLM in a zero-shot fashion. Additionally, we
propose to control the decode-time influence of the USM and LLM using a softmax
temperature, which shows effectiveness in domain adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs越来越多地作为领域导向代理部署，但缺乏评估其遵循领域导向指南能力的综合基准。

Method: 提出GuideBench基准，从规则多样性、更新鲁棒性和人类偏好对齐三个方面评估LLMs。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLMs在遵循领域导向指南方面仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: GuideBench为LLMs的领域导向指南遵循能力提供了评估工具，并揭示了改进方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed as autonomous agents
capable of following user instructions and making decisions in real-world
applications. Previous studies have made notable progress in benchmarking the
instruction following capabilities of LLMs in general domains, with a primary
focus on their inherent commonsense knowledge. Recently, LLMs have been
increasingly deployed as domain-oriented agents, which rely on domain-oriented
guidelines that may conflict with their commonsense knowledge. These guidelines
exhibit two key characteristics: they consist of a wide range of
domain-oriented rules and are subject to frequent updates. Despite these
challenges, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the
domain-oriented guideline following capabilities of LLMs presents a significant
obstacle to their effective assessment and further development. In this paper,
we introduce GuideBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
guideline following performance of LLMs. GuideBench evaluates LLMs on three
critical aspects: (i) adherence to diverse rules, (ii) robustness to rule
updates, and (iii) alignment with human preferences. Experimental results on a
range of LLMs indicate substantial opportunities for improving their ability to
follow domain-oriented guidelines.

*Alicia González Martínez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了古兰经当代正字法（CQO）的系统性，开发了一个Python模块用于添加或移除tajwid层，并利用开罗古兰经的完整文本作为基准研究其语音和韵律过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究古兰经当代正字法的系统性，特别是tajwid（诵读规则）的表示，以开罗古兰经为基准，探索其在语音和韵律研究中的应用。

Method: 开发了一个Python模块，用于在古兰经文本中添加或移除tajwid的拼写层，并利用开罗古兰经的完整数字化文本进行分析。

Result: 开罗古兰经的文本可以作为对齐和比较其他古兰经手稿的基准，为阿拉伯文字的研究提供强大框架。

Conclusion: 通过将所有文本相互映射，可以深入研究附加于辅音骨架上的符号系统的本质，为古兰经研究提供新工具。

Abstract: Contemporary Quranic Orthography (CQO) relies on a precise system of phonetic
notation that can be traced back to the early stages of Islam, when the Quran
was mainly oral in nature and the first written renderings of it served as
memory aids for this oral tradition. The early systems of diacritical marks
created on top of the Quranic Consonantal Text (QCT) motivated the creation and
further development of a fine-grained system of phonetic notation that
represented tajwid-the rules of recitation. We explored the systematicity of
the rules of tajwid, as they are encountered in the Cairo Quran, using a fully
and accurately encoded digital edition of the Quranic text. For this purpose,
we developed a python module that can remove or add the orthographic layer of
tajwid from a Quranic text in CQO. The interesting characteristic of these two
sets of rules is that they address the complete Quranic text of the Cairo
Quran, so they can be used as precise witnesses to study its phonetic and
prosodic processes. From a computational point of view, the text of the Cairo
Quran can be used as a linchpin to align and compare Quranic manuscripts, due
to its richness and completeness. This will let us create a very powerful
framework to work with the Arabic script, not just within an isolated text, but
automatically exploring a specific textual phenomenon in other connected
manuscripts. Having all the texts mapped among each other can serve as a
powerful tool to study the nature of the notation systems of diacritics added
to the consonantal skeleton.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CARES是一个用于评估医疗领域大型语言模型（LLM）安全性的基准测试，包含18,000多个提示，覆盖多种医疗安全原则、危害级别和提示风格。研究发现现有LLM对改写后的有害提示仍易受攻击，同时过度拒绝安全但非典型查询。提出了一种轻量级分类器作为缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域LLM的部署引发了对安全性、对齐性和对抗性操纵的担忧，现有基准测试缺乏临床特异性、分级危害级别和对抗攻击覆盖。

Method: CARES基准测试包含多样化的提示，采用三向响应评估协议（接受、谨慎、拒绝）和细粒度安全评分指标。

Result: 研究发现许多先进LLM对改写后的有害提示仍脆弱，同时过度拒绝安全查询。提出的轻量级分类器能有效检测对抗攻击并引导模型行为。

Conclusion: CARES为医疗LLM在对抗性和模糊条件下的安全性测试与改进提供了严格框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in medical contexts,
raising critical concerns about safety, alignment, and susceptibility to
adversarial manipulation. While prior benchmarks assess model refusal
capabilities for harmful prompts, they often lack clinical specificity, graded
harmfulness levels, and coverage of jailbreak-style attacks. We introduce CARES
(Clinical Adversarial Robustness and Evaluation of Safety), a benchmark for
evaluating LLM safety in healthcare. CARES includes over 18,000 prompts
spanning eight medical safety principles, four harm levels, and four prompting
styles: direct, indirect, obfuscated, and role-play, to simulate both malicious
and benign use cases. We propose a three-way response evaluation protocol
(Accept, Caution, Refuse) and a fine-grained Safety Score metric to assess
model behavior. Our analysis reveals that many state-of-the-art LLMs remain
vulnerable to jailbreaks that subtly rephrase harmful prompts, while also
over-refusing safe but atypically phrased queries. Finally, we propose a
mitigation strategy using a lightweight classifier to detect jailbreak attempts
and steer models toward safer behavior via reminder-based conditioning. CARES
provides a rigorous framework for testing and improving medical LLM safety
under adversarial and ambiguous conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过翻译促进越南两个民族之间的文化交流，解决巴拿语资源匮乏的挑战。

Method: 采用迁移学习方法，利用预训练的越南语模型，结合有限的巴拿语-越南语双语资源进行微调，并通过数据增强和启发式方法优化翻译。

Result: 方法在巴拿语-越南语翻译中表现出高效性，有助于语言扩展和民族间理解。

Conclusion: 该研究为资源稀缺语言的翻译提供了有效解决方案，促进了文化桥梁的构建。

Abstract: This work explores the journey towards achieving Bahnaric-Vietnamese
translation for the sake of culturally bridging the two ethnic groups in
Vietnam. However, translating from Bahnaric to Vietnamese also encounters some
difficulties. The most prominent challenge is the lack of available original
Bahnaric resources source language, including vocabulary, grammar, dialogue
patterns and bilingual corpus, which hinders the data collection process for
training. To address this, we leverage a transfer learning approach using
sequence-to-sequence pre-training language model. First of all, we leverage a
pre-trained Vietnamese language model to capture the characteristics of this
language. Especially, to further serve the purpose of machine translation, we
aim for a sequence-to-sequence model, not encoder-only like BERT or
decoder-only like GPT. Taking advantage of significant similarity between the
two languages, we continue training the model with the currently limited
bilingual resources of Vietnamese-Bahnaric text to perform the transfer
learning from language model to machine translation. Thus, this approach can
help to handle the problem of imbalanced resources between two languages, while
also optimizing the training and computational processes. Additionally, we also
enhanced the datasets using data augmentation to generate additional resources
and defined some heuristic methods to help the translation more precise. Our
approach has been validated to be highly effective for the Bahnaric-Vietnamese
translation model, contributing to the expansion and preservation of languages,
and facilitating better mutual understanding between the two ethnic people.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示显式CoT推理对指令遵循准确性的负面影响，并提出解决方案。

Method: 评估15个模型在两个基准测试上的表现，通过案例研究和注意力分析识别问题，提出四种缓解策略。

Result: CoT推理会分散注意力，导致性能下降；选择性推理策略（尤其是分类器选择性推理）能显著恢复性能。

Conclusion: 这是首次系统性地揭示推理引发的指令遵循失败，并提出了实用的缓解策略。

Abstract: Reasoning-enhanced large language models (RLLMs), whether explicitly trained
for reasoning or prompted via chain-of-thought (CoT), have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on many complex reasoning tasks. However, we
uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon: explicit CoT
reasoning can significantly degrade instruction-following accuracy. Evaluating
15 models on two benchmarks: IFEval (with simple, rule-verifiable constraints)
and ComplexBench (with complex, compositional constraints), we consistently
observe performance drops when CoT prompting is applied. Through large-scale
case studies and an attention-based analysis, we identify common patterns where
reasoning either helps (e.g., with formatting or lexical precision) or hurts
(e.g., by neglecting simple constraints or introducing unnecessary content). We
propose a metric, constraint attention, to quantify model focus during
generation and show that CoT reasoning often diverts attention away from
instruction-relevant tokens. To mitigate these effects, we introduce and
evaluate four strategies: in-context learning, self-reflection, self-selective
reasoning, and classifier-selective reasoning. Our results demonstrate that
selective reasoning strategies, particularly classifier-selective reasoning,
can substantially recover lost performance. To our knowledge, this is the first
work to systematically expose reasoning-induced failures in
instruction-following and offer practical mitigation strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs和CoT方法在生成创意表达（如幽默和讽刺）方面表现不足，且现有基准的模态和类别有限。

Method: 提出GODBench基准（视频和文本模态）和RoT多步推理框架（受物理波动传播启发）。

Result: 实验显示现有方法在创意评论生成上仍有挑战，而RoT显著提升了创造力。

Conclusion: RoT为MLLM的创意生成提供了有效途径，GODBench为相关研究提供了新基准。

Abstract: Video Comment Art enhances user engagement by providing creative content that
conveys humor, satire, or emotional resonance, requiring a nuanced and
comprehensive grasp of cultural and contextual subtleties. Although Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have demonstrated
strong reasoning abilities in STEM tasks (e.g. mathematics and coding), they
still struggle to generate creative expressions such as resonant jokes and
insightful satire. Moreover, existing benchmarks are constrained by their
limited modalities and insufficient categories, hindering the exploration of
comprehensive creativity in video-based Comment Art creation. To address these
limitations, we introduce GODBench, a novel benchmark that integrates video and
text modalities to systematically evaluate MLLMs' abilities to compose Comment
Art. Furthermore, inspired by the propagation patterns of waves in physics, we
propose Ripple of Thought (RoT), a multi-step reasoning framework designed to
enhance the creativity of MLLMs. Extensive experiments reveal that existing
MLLMs and CoT methods still face significant challenges in understanding and
generating creative video comments. In contrast, RoT provides an effective
approach to improve creative composing, highlighting its potential to drive
meaningful advancements in MLLM-based creativity. GODBench is publicly

TL;DR: 论文探讨了数据压缩与大型语言模型（LLMs）能力之间的关系，特别是在代码智能领域。通过多语言、多任务的基准测试和新的评估方法，揭示了代码智能与压缩效率之间的对数关系，修正了之前线性关系的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究数据压缩与LLMs在代码智能领域的关系，解决现有方法在多语言、多任务评估中的不足，并提供更公平的评估框架。

Method: 采用多语言、多任务的代码基准测试，引入轻量级透明的训练方法“Format Annealing”，并使用新的代码验证集测量压缩效率（BPC）。

Result: 实证结果显示代码智能与BPC之间存在对数关系，修正了之前线性关系的假设。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对压缩在代码智能发展中作用的更细致理解，并为代码领域贡献了稳健的评估框架。

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between data compression and the capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial, especially in specialized domains
like code intelligence. Prior work posited a linear relationship between
compression and general intelligence. However, it overlooked the multifaceted
nature of code that encompasses diverse programming languages and tasks, and
struggled with fair evaluation of modern Code LLMs. We address this by
evaluating a diverse array of open-source Code LLMs on comprehensive
multi-language, multi-task code benchmarks. To address the challenge of
efficient and fair evaluation of pre-trained LLMs' code intelligence, we
introduce \textit{Format Annealing}, a lightweight, transparent training
methodology designed to assess the intrinsic capabilities of these pre-trained
models equitably. Compression efficacy, measured as bits-per-character (BPC),
is determined using a novel, large-scale, and previously unseen code validation
set derived from GitHub. Our empirical results reveal a fundamental logarithmic
relationship between measured code intelligence and BPC. This finding refines
prior hypotheses of linearity, which we suggest are likely observations of the
logarithmic curve's tail under specific, limited conditions. Our work provides
a more nuanced understanding of compression's role in developing code
intelligence and contributes a robust evaluation framework in the code domain.

Motivation: 当前医学推理基准混淆推理与事实记忆，需分离以更准确评估模型能力。

Method: 使用PubMedBERT分类器将11个生物医学QA基准分为推理和知识两类，评估模型表现，并通过微调和强化学习训练BioMed-R1。

Result: 仅32.8%问题需复杂推理；生物医学模型在对抗测试中表现较差，而通用模型更稳健；BioMed-R1在同类模型中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 未来可通过结合临床案例报告及对抗训练进一步提升模型推理能力。

Abstract: Medical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) aims to emulate clinicians'
diagnostic thinking, but current benchmarks such as MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and
PubMedQA often mix reasoning with factual recall. We address this by separating
11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using
a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human
performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require
complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1)
and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent
gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, m1 scores 60.5
on knowledge but only 47.1 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are
misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply,
while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address
this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on
reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly
sized models. Further gains may come from incorporating clinical case reports
and training with adversarial and backtracking scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分类法评估指标未能覆盖某些错误类型，因此需要新的指标来更全面地评估分类法质量。

Method: 第一种指标通过计算语义与分类相似性的相关性评估鲁棒性；第二种指标利用自然语言推理评估逻辑充分性。

Abstract: We introduce two reference-free metrics for quality evaluation of taxonomies.
The first metric evaluates robustness by calculating the correlation between
semantic and taxonomic similarity, covering a type of error not handled by
existing metrics. The second uses Natural Language Inference to assess logical
adequacy. Both metrics are tested on five taxonomies and are shown to correlate
well with F1 against gold-standard taxonomies.

Abstract: Preference datasets are essential for training general-domain,
instruction-following language models with Reinforcement Learning from Human

data collection, meaning there is a constant need to advance the quality and
diversity of openly available preference data. To address this need, we
introduce HelpSteer3-Preference, a permissively licensed (CC-BY-4.0),
high-quality, human-annotated preference dataset comprising of over 40,000

achieve top performance on RM-Bench (82.4%) and JudgeBench (73.7%). This
represents a substantial improvement (~10% absolute) over the previously
best-reported results from existing RMs. We demonstrate HelpSteer3-Preference

Result: 模型Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-PPO在测试通过率96.0%和平均加速1.47x上优于gcc -O3。

Conclusion: 强化学习能有效释放LLMs在汇编代码优化中的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a
wide range of programming tasks, yet their potential for code optimization
remains underexplored. This work investigates whether LLMs can optimize the
performance of assembly code, where fine-grained control over execution enables
improvements that are difficult to express in high-level languages. We present
a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs using Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), guided by a reward function that considers both functional
correctness, validated through test cases, and execution performance relative
to the industry-standard compiler gcc -O3. To support this study, we introduce
a benchmark of 8,072 real-world programs. Our model, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-PPO,
achieves 96.0% test pass rates and an average speedup of 1.47x over the gcc -O3
baseline, outperforming all 20 other models evaluated, including
Claude-3.7-sonnet. These results indicate that reinforcement learning can
unlock the potential of LLMs to serve as effective optimizers for assembly code
performance.

TL;DR: SoftCoT++通过扰动潜在思维和对比学习，在连续潜在空间中实现多样化推理路径探索，显著提升了推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续潜在空间推理方法（如SoftCoT）因固定潜在表示限制了多样化探索，SoftCoT++旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过多组专用初始令牌扰动潜在思维，并应用对比学习促进软思维表示的多样性。

Result: 在五个推理基准和两种LLM架构上，SoftCoT++显著优于SoftCoT，并与自一致性等技术兼容。

Conclusion: SoftCoT++为连续空间推理提供了多样化探索的有效方法，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) refers to approaches that improve reasoning
performance by allocating extra computation during inference, without altering
the model's parameters. While existing TTS methods operate in a discrete token
space by generating more intermediate steps, recent studies in Coconut and
SoftCoT have demonstrated that thinking in the continuous latent space can
further enhance the reasoning performance. Such latent thoughts encode
informative thinking without the information loss associated with
autoregressive token generation, sparking increased interest in
continuous-space reasoning. Unlike discrete decoding, where repeated sampling
enables exploring diverse reasoning paths, latent representations in continuous
space are fixed for a given input, which limits diverse exploration, as all
decoded paths originate from the same latent thought. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce SoftCoT++ to extend SoftCoT to the Test-Time Scaling
paradigm by enabling diverse exploration of thinking paths. Specifically, we
perturb latent thoughts via multiple specialized initial tokens and apply
contrastive learning to promote diversity among soft thought representations.
Experiments across five reasoning benchmarks and two distinct LLM architectures
demonstrate that SoftCoT++ significantly boosts SoftCoT and also outperforms
SoftCoT with self-consistency scaling. Moreover, it shows strong compatibility
with conventional scaling techniques such as self-consistency. Source code is

Motivation: 探索先进语言模型是否能更准确地解释人类阅读行为中的预测效应，尤其是凝视时长。

Method: 使用Transformer模型（GPT2、LLaMA-7B和LLaMA2-7B）分析Rioplantense西班牙语读者的凝视时长数据，并与早期模型（如N-grams和LSTM）对比。

Result: Transformer模型在解释凝视时长方差方面优于早期模型，但仍无法完全匹配人类预测能力。

Conclusion: 尽管先进语言模型有所提升，其预测方式仍与人类读者存在差异。

Abstract: Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have led to the
development of highly sophisticated language models for text generation. In
parallel, neuroscience has increasingly employed these models to explore
cognitive processes involved in language comprehension. Previous research has
shown that models such as N-grams and LSTM networks can partially account for
predictability effects in explaining eye movement behaviors, specifically Gaze
Duration, during reading. In this study, we extend these findings by evaluating
transformer-based models (GPT2, LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA2-7B) to further investigate
this relationship. Our results indicate that these architectures outperform
earlier models in explaining the variance in Gaze Durations recorded from
Rioplantense Spanish readers. However, similar to previous studies, these
models still fail to account for the entirety of the variance captured by human
predictability. These findings suggest that, despite their advancements,
state-of-the-art language models continue to predict language in ways that
differ from human readers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生理信号（如EEG）的情绪识别受限于跨主体差异和噪声标签，现有方法难以处理连续无标记数据流。

Method: 采用双层自监督持续学习框架，结合动态缓冲区迭代优化和伪标签分配，包括快速适应模块和聚类映射模块。

Result: 在主流EEG任务中验证，SSOCL能适应连续数据流并保持跨主体泛化能力，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SSOCL框架有效解决了连续无标记生理数据流的情绪识别问题，提升了模型的适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Emotion recognition through physiological signals such as
electroencephalogram (EEG) has become an essential aspect of affective
computing and provides an objective way to capture human emotions. However,
physiological data characterized by cross-subject variability and noisy labels
hinder the performance of emotion recognition models. Existing domain
adaptation and continual learning methods struggle to address these issues,
especially under realistic conditions where data is continuously streamed and
unlabeled. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel bi-level
self-supervised continual learning framework, SSOCL, based on a dynamic memory
buffer. This bi-level architecture iteratively refines the dynamic buffer and
pseudo-label assignments to effectively retain representative samples, enabling
generalization from continuous, unlabeled physiological data streams for
emotion recognition. The assigned pseudo-labels are subsequently leveraged for
accurate emotion prediction. Key components of the framework, including a fast
adaptation module and a cluster-mapping module, enable robust learning and
effective handling of evolving data streams. Experimental validation on two
mainstream EEG tasks demonstrates the framework's ability to adapt to
continuous data streams while maintaining strong generalization across
subjects, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Over the past decades, computer-aided diagnosis tools for breast cancer have
been developed to enhance screening procedures, yet their clinical adoption
remains challenged by data variability and inherent biases. Although foundation
models (FMs) have recently demonstrated impressive generalizability and
transfer learning capabilities by leveraging vast and diverse datasets, their
performance can be undermined by spurious correlations that arise from
variations in image quality, labeling uncertainty, and sensitive patient
attributes. In this work, we explore the fairness and bias of FMs for breast
mammography classification by leveraging a large pool of datasets from diverse
sources-including data from underrepresented regions and an in-house dataset.
Our extensive experiments show that while modality-specific pre-training of FMs
enhances performance, classifiers trained on features from individual datasets
fail to generalize across domains. Aggregating datasets improves overall
performance, yet does not fully mitigate biases, leading to significant
disparities across under-represented subgroups such as extreme breast densities
and age groups. Furthermore, while domain-adaptation strategies can reduce
these disparities, they often incur a performance trade-off. In contrast,
fairness-aware techniques yield more stable and equitable performance across
subgroups. These findings underscore the necessity of incorporating rigorous
fairness evaluations and mitigation strategies into FM-based models to foster
inclusive and generalizable AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了多模态大语言模型中视觉和文本模态的表示一致性，通过机器教学理论评估了两种表示形式（图像和坐标）的教学复杂度，发现图像表示更高效，但概念的教学复杂度在不同模态中表现相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型是否真正实现了模态间的共同表示，以及不同模态（图像和文本）在表示同一概念时的教学复杂度差异。

Method: 使用机器教学理论，在Quick, Draw!数据集中选择对象，分别以图像（位图）和坐标（TikZ格式）两种表示形式进行教学，评估教学复杂度和准确性。

Result: 图像表示通常需要更少的教学片段且准确率更高，但概念的教学复杂度在不同模态中表现相似，表明概念的简洁性可能是跨模态的固有属性。

Conclusion: 多模态模型的表示一致性部分成立，概念的简洁性可能独立于具体模态，这对理解模态间的共同表示提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models have become multimodal, and many of them are said to
integrate their modalities using common representations. If this were true, a
drawing of a car as an image, for instance, should map to the similar area in
the latent space as a textual description of the strokes that conform the
drawing. To explore this in a black-box access regime to these models, we
propose the use of machine teaching, a theory that studies the minimal set of
examples a teacher needs to choose so that the learner captures the concept. In
this paper we evaluate the complexity of teaching visual-language models a
subset of objects in the Quick, Draw! dataset using two presentations: raw
images as bitmaps and trace coordinates in TikZ format. The results indicate
that image-based representations generally require fewer segments and achieve
higher accuracy than coordinate-based representations. But, surprisingly, the
teaching size usually ranks concepts similarly across both modalities, even
when controlling for (a human proxy of) concept priors, suggesting that the
simplicity of concepts may be an inherent property that transcends modality
representations.

Motivation: 恶意无人机对下一代网络（NGN）构成威胁，如未经授权的监视、数据盗窃和危险物品投递，因此需要有效的检测方法。

Method: 采用4层TSMamba架构的AE生成残差值，再通过ResNet分类器处理，实现低复杂度和高准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法具有鲁棒性和可扩展性，适合大规模部署，为NGN环境中的恶意无人机检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Malicious Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) present a significant threat to
next-generation networks (NGNs), posing risks such as unauthorized
surveillance, data theft, and the delivery of hazardous materials. This paper
proposes an integrated (AE)-classifier system to detect malicious UAVs. The
proposed AE, based on a 4-layer Tri-orientated Spatial Mamba (TSMamba)
architecture, effectively captures complex spatial relationships crucial for
identifying malicious UAV activities. The first phase involves generating
residual values through the AE, which are subsequently processed by a
ResNet-based classifier. This classifier leverages the residual values to
achieve lower complexity and higher accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in both binary and multi-class classification
scenarios, achieving up to 99.8 % recall compared to 96.7 % in the benchmark.
Additionally, our method reduces computational complexity, making it more
suitable for large-scale deployment. These results highlight the robustness and
scalability of our approach, offering an effective solution for malicious UAV
detection in NGN environments.

Motivation: SRGAN在单图像增强中表现优异，但未考虑视频处理所需的时序连续性，因此需要改进以适用于视频数据。

Method: 提出了一种结合3D非局部块的改进框架，通过基于块的学习和高级数据退化技术训练模型，以捕捉时空维度的关系。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在时序连贯性、纹理清晰度和减少视觉伪影方面优于传统单图像方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为视频增强任务提供了实用的学习解决方案，适用于流媒体、游戏和数字修复等领域。

Abstract: This study introduces an enhanced approach to video super-resolution by
extending ordinary Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) Super-Resolution
Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) structure to handle spatio-temporal
data. While SRGAN has proven effective for single-image enhancement, its design
does not account for the temporal continuity required in video processing. To
address this, a modified framework that incorporates 3D Non-Local Blocks is
proposed, which is enabling the model to capture relationships across both
spatial and temporal dimensions. An experimental training pipeline is
developed, based on patch-wise learning and advanced data degradation
techniques, to simulate real-world video conditions and learn from both local
and global structures and details. This helps the model generalize better and
maintain stability across varying video content while maintaining the general
structure besides the pixel-wise correctness. Two model variants-one larger and
one more lightweight-are presented to explore the trade-offs between
performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate improved temporal
coherence, sharper textures, and fewer visual artifacts compared to traditional
single-image methods. This work contributes to the development of practical,
learning-based solutions for video enhancement tasks, with potential
applications in streaming, gaming, and digital restoration.

Motivation: 红外图像中目标纹理和结构信息有限，传统卷积核和池化操作导致特征损失和适应性不足。

Method: 结合多感受野特征交互卷积（MRFFIConv）、小波频率增强下采样（WFED）、高低特征融合（HLFF）和全局中值增强注意力（GMEA）模块。

Result: 在SIRST、NUDT-SIRST和IRSTD-1k数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在复杂背景下。

Conclusion: ARFC-WAHNet通过自适应特征提取和多模块协作，显著提升了红外小目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is critical in both civilian and
military applications. However, the limited texture and structural information
in infrared images makes accurate detection particularly challenging. Although
recent deep learning-based methods have improved performance, their use of
conventional convolution kernels limits adaptability to complex scenes and
diverse targets. Moreover, pooling operations often cause feature loss and
insufficient exploitation of image information. To address these issues, we
propose an adaptive receptive field convolution and wavelet-attentive
hierarchical network for infrared small target detection (ARFC-WAHNet). This
network incorporates a multi-receptive field feature interaction convolution
(MRFFIConv) module to adaptively extract discriminative features by integrating
multiple convolutional branches with a gated unit. A wavelet frequency
enhancement downsampling (WFED) module leverages Haar wavelet transform and
frequency-domain reconstruction to enhance target features and suppress
background noise. Additionally, we introduce a high-low feature fusion (HLFF)
module for integrating low-level details with high-level semantics, and a
global median enhancement attention (GMEA) module to improve feature diversity
and expressiveness via global attention. Experiments on public datasets SIRST,
NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1k demonstrate that ARFC-WAHNet outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods in both detection accuracy and robustness,
particularly under complex backgrounds. The code is available at

Motivation: 由于LiDAR点云的稀疏性和不规则结构，点云超分辨率问题具有挑战性，尤其是在新视角下进行上采样。

Method: 采用基于Hough Voting的投影技术和Hole Compensation策略消除水平线性空洞，利用Visual State Space模型和多向扫描机制优化3D空间结构信息。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，SRMamba在定性和定量评估中均显著优于其他算法。

Conclusion: SRMamba有效解决了稀疏场景中LiDAR点云超分辨率的挑战，尤其在3D空间结构恢复方面表现优异。

Abstract: In recent years, range-view-based LiDAR point cloud super-resolution
techniques attract significant attention as a low-cost method for generating
higher-resolution point cloud data. However, due to the sparsity and irregular
structure of LiDAR point clouds, the point cloud super-resolution problem
remains a challenging topic, especially for point cloud upsampling under novel
views. In this paper, we propose SRMamba, a novel method for super-resolution
of LiDAR point clouds in sparse scenes, addressing the key challenge of
recovering the 3D spatial structure of point clouds from novel views.
Specifically, we implement projection technique based on Hough Voting and Hole
Compensation strategy to eliminate horizontally linear holes in range image. To
improve the establishment of long-distance dependencies and to focus on
potential geometric features in vertical 3D space, we employ Visual State Space
model and Multi-Directional Scanning mechanism to mitigate the loss of 3D
spatial structural information due to the range image. Additionally, an
asymmetric U-Net network adapts to the input characteristics of LiDARs with
different beam counts, enabling super-resolution reconstruction for multi-beam
point clouds. We conduct a series of experiments on multiple challenging public
LiDAR datasets (SemanticKITTI and nuScenes), and SRMamba demonstrates
significant superiority over other algorithms in both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: MIRAGE为未来时空推理研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are core components of human cognition,
encompassing object recognition, spatial relational understanding, and dynamic
reasoning. Despite progress in computer vision, existing benchmarks reveal
significant gaps in models' abilities to accurately recognize object attributes
and reason about spatial relationships, both essential for dynamic reasoning.
To address these limitations, we propose MIRAGE, a multi-modal benchmark
designed to evaluate models' capabilities in Counting (object attribute
recognition), Relation (spatial relational reasoning), and Counting with
Relation. Through diverse and complex scenarios requiring fine-grained
recognition and reasoning, MIRAGE highlights critical limitations in
state-of-the-art models, underscoring the need for improved representations and
reasoning frameworks. By targeting these foundational abilities, MIRAGE
provides a pathway toward spatiotemporal reasoning in future research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着长上下文视觉语言模型的发展，缺乏全面评估其能力的基准测试，MMLongBench填补了这一空白。

Method: 通过跨模态标记化方案，将样本标准化为5种输入长度（8K-128K），涵盖多种图像类型和任务类别。

Result: 评估46个模型显示：单任务表现不能代表整体能力；开源和闭源模型均面临挑战；推理能力强的模型表现更好。

Conclusion: MMLongBench为诊断和推进下一代LCVLMs提供了基础，揭示了未来改进的空间。

Abstract: The rapid extension of context windows in large vision-language models has
given rise to long-context vision-language models (LCVLMs), which are capable
of handling hundreds of images with interleaved text tokens in a single forward
pass. In this work, we introduce MMLongBench, the first benchmark covering a
diverse set of long-context vision-language tasks, to evaluate LCVLMs
effectively and thoroughly. MMLongBench is composed of 13,331 examples spanning
five different categories of downstream tasks, such as Visual RAG and Many-Shot
ICL. It also provides broad coverage of image types, including various natural
and synthetic images. To assess the robustness of the models to different input
lengths, all examples are delivered at five standardized input lengths (8K-128K
tokens) via a cross-modal tokenization scheme that combines vision patches and
text tokens. Through a thorough benchmarking of 46 closed-source and
open-source LCVLMs, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the current models'
vision-language long-context ability. Our results show that: i) performance on
a single task is a weak proxy for overall long-context capability; ii) both
closed-source and open-source models face challenges in long-context
vision-language tasks, indicating substantial room for future improvement; iii)
models with stronger reasoning ability tend to exhibit better long-context
performance. By offering wide task coverage, various image types, and rigorous
length control, MMLongBench provides the missing foundation for diagnosing and
advancing the next generation of LCVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言先验是大型视觉语言模型产生幻觉内容的主要原因之一，导致模型生成视觉不一致但语言上合理的内容。

Method: 提出CICD方法，通过识别关键和有害先验，并利用对比解码消除有害先验，同时保持文本流畅性和连贯性。

Result: 在四个基准测试和六个LVLM上验证了CICD的有效性，尤其在图像描述任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: CICD能有效缓解语言先验问题，减少幻觉内容，同时保持视觉信息完整性。

Abstract: Language priors constitute one of the primary causes of hallucinations in
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), driving the models to generate
linguistically plausible yet visually inconsistent content. The language priors
in LVLMs originate from the linguistic knowledge inherited from their
pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) backbone. Consequently, this
characteristic is an intrinsic property of the model that remains independent
of visual inputs. Inspired by the finding that language priors are consistent
across images, we propose Cross-Image Contrastive Decoding (CICD), a simple yet
effective training-free method to alleviate language priors in LVLMs. CICD
first identifies essential and detrimental priors, and then employs contrastive
decoding to eliminate the detrimental ones. This approach simultaneously
prevents LVLMs from generating hallucinated content while maintaining textual
fluency and coherence. Furthermore, the limited information overlap between
images helps prevent visual information loss during contrastive decoding. We
validate the effectiveness of CICD on four benchmarks with six LVLMs. Our
experiments demonstrate that CICD performs remarkably well in mitigating
language priors, especially in the image captioning task, where such priors are
most pronounced. Code will be released once accepted.

Motivation: 传统MIL模型缺乏对动态数据集的适应性，而现有CL方法在MIL中效果有限。本文分析了注意力层遗忘问题，并提出解决方案。

Method: 提出AKD和PMP：AKD保留注意力层知识，PMP选择性存储信息丰富的图像块（伪袋）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在WSI数据集上显著提升了准确性和内存效率，优于现有CL方法。

Conclusion: 为大规模弱标注临床数据集的CL提供了基础，推动了更适应性和鲁棒的诊断模型发展。

Abstract: Advances in medical imaging and deep learning have propelled progress in
whole slide image (WSI) analysis, with multiple instance learning (MIL) showing
promise for efficient and accurate diagnostics. However, conventional MIL
models often lack adaptability to evolving datasets, as they rely on static
training that cannot incorporate new information without extensive retraining.
Applying continual learning (CL) to MIL models is a possible solution, but
often sees limited improvements. In this paper, we analyze CL in the context of
attention MIL models and find that the model forgetting is mainly concentrated
in the attention layers of the MIL model. Using the results of this analysis we
propose two components for improving CL on MIL: Attention Knowledge
Distillation (AKD) and the Pseudo-Bag Memory Pool (PMP). AKD mitigates
catastrophic forgetting by focusing on retaining attention layer knowledge
between learning sessions, while PMP reduces the memory footprint by
selectively storing only the most informative patches, or ``pseudo-bags'' from
WSIs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly
improves both accuracy and memory efficiency on diverse WSI datasets,
outperforming current state-of-the-art CL methods. This work provides a
foundation for CL in large-scale, weakly annotated clinical datasets, paving
the way for more adaptable and resilient diagnostic models.

Motivation: 验证AI生成图像的真实性日益重要，但现有视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在预训练中缺乏相关标签，导致其分类能力未被充分探索。

Method: 使用冻结的CLIP模型提取视觉嵌入，通过轻量级网络和微调最终分类器，验证CLIP嵌入是否隐含AI生成信息。

Result: 在CIFAKE基准上达到95%准确率，少量数据微调后为85%。某些图像类型（如广角照片和油画）分类困难。

Conclusion: CLIP嵌入可用于AI生成图像分类，但特定类型图像仍具挑战性，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Verifying the authenticity of AI-generated images presents a growing
challenge on social media platforms these days. While vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP outdo in multimodal representation, their capacity for
AI-generated image classification is underexplored due to the absence of such
labels during the pre-training process. This work investigates whether CLIP
embeddings inherently contain information indicative of AI generation. A
proposed pipeline extracts visual embeddings using a frozen CLIP model, feeds
its embeddings to lightweight networks, and fine-tunes only the final
classifier. Experiments on the public CIFAKE benchmark show the performance
reaches 95% accuracy without language reasoning. Few-shot adaptation to curated
custom with 20% of the data results in performance to 85%. A closed-source
baseline (Gemini-2.0) has the best zero-shot accuracy yet fails on specific
styles. Notably, some specific image types, such as wide-angle photographs and
oil paintings, pose significant challenges to classification. These results
indicate previously unexplored difficulties in classifying certain types of
AI-generated images, revealing new and more specific questions in this domain
that are worth further investigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在无约束环境下（如主体远离或背对相机）因2D观测与3D视线方向多样性导致的视线估计挑战。

Method: 利用3D姿态和物体位置表示主体与场景，通过方向-距离分解的位置编码（D$^3$）学习空间关系，并在自我中心空间中对齐上下文。

Result: 在单帧设置下，相比基线方法，平均角度误差降低了13%-37%。

Conclusion: GA3CE通过3D上下文编码和方向-距离分解的位置编码，显著提升了3D视线估计的准确性。

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D gaze estimation approach that learns spatial
relationships between the subject and objects in the scene, and outputs 3D gaze
direction. Our method targets unconstrained settings, including cases where
close-up views of the subject's eyes are unavailable, such as when the subject
is distant or facing away. Previous approaches typically rely on either 2D
appearance alone or incorporate limited spatial cues using depth maps in the
non-learnable post-processing step. Estimating 3D gaze direction from 2D
observations in these scenarios is challenging; variations in subject pose,
scene layout, and gaze direction, combined with differing camera poses, yield
diverse 2D appearances and 3D gaze directions even when targeting the same 3D
scene. To address this issue, we propose GA3CE: Gaze-Aware 3D Context Encoding.
Our method represents subject and scene using 3D poses and object positions,
treating them as 3D context to learn spatial relationships in 3D space.
Inspired by human vision, we align this context in an egocentric space,
significantly reducing spatial complexity. Furthermore, we propose D$^3$
(direction-distance-decomposed) positional encoding to better capture the
spatial relationship between 3D context and gaze direction in direction and
distance space. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements, reducing mean
angle error by 13%-37% compared to leading baselines on benchmark datasets in
single-frame settings.

Conclusion: 稀疏化方法有效减少参数并保持或提升性能，为骨架动作识别提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs) showcase impressive
performance in skeleton-based human action recognition (HAR). However, despite
the development of numerous models, their recognition performance does not
differ significantly after aligning the input settings. With this observation,
we hypothesize that ST-GCNs are over-parameterized for HAR, a conjecture
subsequently confirmed through experiments employing the lottery ticket
hypothesis. Additionally, a novel sparse ST-GCNs generator is proposed, which
trains a sparse architecture from a randomly initialized dense network while
maintaining comparable performance levels to the dense components. Moreover, we
generate multi-level sparsity ST-GCNs by integrating sparse structures at
various sparsity levels and demonstrate that the assembled model yields a
significant enhancement in HAR performance. Thorough experiments on four
datasets, including NTU-RGB+D 60(120), Kinetics-400, and FineGYM, demonstrate
that the proposed sparse ST-GCNs can achieve comparable performance to their
dense components. Even with 95% fewer parameters, the sparse ST-GCNs exhibit a
degradation of <1% in top-1 accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-level sparsity
ST-GCNs, which require only 66% of the parameters of the dense ST-GCNs,
demonstrate an improvement of >1% in top-1 accuracy. The code is available at

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is critical for achieving safe and reliable
autonomous driving. Compared to camera-only perception systems, multi-modal
pipelines, especially LiDAR-camera fusion methods, can produce more accurate
and detailed predictions. Although most existing works utilize a dense
grid-based representation, in which the entire 3D space is uniformly divided
into discrete voxels, the emergence of 3D Gaussians provides a compact and
continuous object-centric representation. In this work, we propose a
multi-modal Gaussian-based semantic occupancy prediction framework utilizing 3D
deformable attention, named as GaussianFormer3D. We introduce a
voxel-to-Gaussian initialization strategy to provide 3D Gaussians with geometry
priors from LiDAR data, and design a LiDAR-guided 3D deformable attention
mechanism for refining 3D Gaussians with LiDAR-camera fusion features in a
lifted 3D space. We conducted extensive experiments on both on-road and
off-road datasets, demonstrating that our GaussianFormer3D achieves high
prediction accuracy that is comparable to state-of-the-art multi-modal
fusion-based methods with reduced memory consumption and improved efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning and aerial imaging have transformed
wildlife monitoring, enabling researchers to survey wildlife populations at
unprecedented scales. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provide a cost-effective
means of capturing high-resolution imagery, particularly for monitoring densely
populated seabird colonies. In this study, we assess the performance of a
general-purpose avian detection model, BirdDetector, in estimating the breeding
population of Salvin's albatross (Thalassarche salvini) on the Bounty Islands,
New Zealand. Using drone-derived imagery, we evaluate the model's effectiveness
in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, incorporating enhanced inference
techniques and stronger augmentation methods. Our findings indicate that while
applying the model in a zero-shot setting offers a strong baseline, fine-tuning
with annotations from the target domain and stronger image augmentation leads
to marked improvements in detection accuracy. These results highlight the
potential of leveraging pre-trained deep-learning models for species-specific
monitoring in remote and challenging environments.

<details>

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在个性化生成新主题时面临遗忘、过拟合和计算开销大的挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1) 使用未修改的SDXL生成通用场景；2) 通过基于分割的图像到图像流程插入个性化主题。

Result: 在SDXL上DINO相似度得分达到0.789，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功分离主题编码与整体构图，保留了模型的生成能力并实现了高保真个性化。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable
Diffusion, have enabled the generation of highly detailed and semantically rich
images. However, personalizing these models to represent novel subjects based
on a few reference images remains challenging. This often leads to catastrophic
forgetting, overfitting, or large computational overhead.We propose a two-stage
pipeline that addresses these limitations by leveraging LoRA-based fine-tuning
on the attention weights within the U-Net of the Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)
model. First, we use the unmodified SDXL to generate a generic scene by
replacing the subject with its class label. Then, we selectively insert the
personalized subject through a segmentation-driven image-to-image (Img2Img)
pipeline that uses the trained LoRA weights.This framework isolates the subject
encoding from the overall composition, thus preserving SDXL's broader
generative capabilities while integrating the new subject in a high-fidelity
manner. Our method achieves a DINO similarity score of 0.789 on SDXL,
outperforming existing personalized text-to-image approaches.

Result: 生成的点云包含几何和语义信息，可用于训练和评估深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为森林点云语义分割提供了有效的数据生成工具。

Abstract: Although the use of remote sensing technologies for monitoring forested
environments has gained increasing attention, publicly available point cloud
datasets remain scarce due to the high costs, sensor requirements, and
time-intensive nature of their acquisition. Moreover, as far as we are aware,
there are no public annotated datasets generated through Structure From Motion
(SfM) algorithms applied to imagery, which may be due to the lack of SfM
algorithms that can map semantic segmentation information into an accurate
point cloud, especially in a challenging environment like forests.
  In this work, we present a novel pipeline for generating semantically
segmented point clouds of forest environments. Using a custom-built forest
simulator, we generate realistic RGB images of diverse forest scenes along with
their corresponding semantic segmentation masks. These labeled images are then
processed using modified open-source SfM software capable of preserving
semantic information during 3D reconstruction. The resulting point clouds
provide both geometric and semantic detail, offering a valuable resource for
training and evaluating deep learning models aimed at segmenting real forest
point clouds obtained via SfM.

Motivation: 微创手术（MIS）存在视觉和技术挑战，现有机器学习方法依赖小规模标注数据。VLMs的成功引发了对其在手术领域适应性的研究兴趣。

Method: 通过在多类手术数据集（如腹腔镜和内镜黏膜下剥离术）上测试多种VLMs，评估其性能和局限性。

Result: 基准测试显示，VLMs在语言与手术场景区域的一致性关联方面存在显著不足。

Conclusion: 通用VLMs在手术领域表现有限，需进一步改进以适应复杂的手术场景。

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) presents significant visual and technical
challenges, including surgical instrument classification and understanding
surgical action involving instruments, verbs, and anatomical targets. While
many machine learning-based methods have been developed for surgical
understanding, they typically rely on procedure- and task-specific models
trained on small, manually annotated datasets. In contrast, the recent success
of vision-language models (VLMs) trained on large volumes of raw image-text
pairs has demonstrated strong adaptability to diverse visual data and a range
of downstream tasks. This opens meaningful research questions: how well do
these general-purpose VLMs perform in the surgical domain? In this work, we
explore those questions by benchmarking several VLMs across diverse surgical
datasets, including general laparoscopic procedures and endoscopic submucosal
dissection, to assess their current capabilities and limitations. Our benchmark
reveals key gaps in the models' ability to consistently link language to the
correct regions in surgical scenes.

Motivation: 现有生物医学图像分割模型在未见域数据上表现不佳，缺乏视觉-语言知识是主要原因。

Method: 提出Vision-Language Semantic Alignment（VLSA）模块注入VLK，并设计Semantic Boundary Regularization（SBR）优化边界感知。

Conclusion: uLLSAM通过结合MLLMs和SAM，显著提升了跨域分割的泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of regions of interest in biomedical images holds
substantial value in image analysis. Although several foundation models for
biomedical segmentation have currently achieved excellent performance on
certain datasets, they typically demonstrate sub-optimal performance on unseen
domain data. We owe the deficiency to lack of vision-language knowledge before
segmentation. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) bring outstanding
understanding and reasoning capabilities to multimodal tasks, which inspires us
to leverage MLLMs to inject Vision-Language Knowledge (VLK), thereby enabling
vision models to demonstrate superior generalization capabilities on
cross-domain datasets. In this paper, we propose using MLLMs to guide SAM in
learning microscopy crose-domain data, unifying Segment Anything in Microscopy,
named uLLSAM. Specifically, we propose the Vision-Language Semantic Alignment
(VLSA) module, which injects VLK into Segment Anything Model (SAM). We find
that after SAM receives global VLK prompts, its performance improves
significantly, but there are deficiencies in boundary contour perception.
Therefore, we further propose Semantic Boundary Regularization (SBR) to prompt
SAM. Our method achieves performance improvements of 7.71% in Dice and 12.10%
in SA across 9 in-domain microscopy datasets, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. Our method also demonstrates improvements of 6.79% in Dice and
10.08% in SA across 10 out-ofdomain datasets, exhibiting strong generalization
capabilities. Code is available at https://github.com/ieellee/uLLSAM.

Conclusion: 本文首次提出完全弱监督的类增量语义分割方法，实验验证了其有效性，为实际应用提供了低成本解决方案。

Abstract: This work addresses the task of completely weakly supervised
class-incremental learning for semantic segmentation to learn segmentation for
both base and additional novel classes using only image-level labels. While
class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) is crucial for handling diverse
and newly emerging objects in the real world, traditional CISS methods require
expensive pixel-level annotations for training. To overcome this limitation,
partially weakly-supervised approaches have recently been proposed. However, to
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a completely
weakly-supervised method for CISS. To achieve this, we propose to generate
robust pseudo-labels by combining pseudo-labels from a localizer and a sequence
of foundation models based on their uncertainty. Moreover, to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting, we introduce an exemplar-guided data augmentation
method that generates diverse images containing both previous and novel classes
with guidance. Finally, we conduct experiments in three common experimental
settings: 15-5 VOC, 10-10 VOC, and COCO-to-VOC, and in two scenarios: disjoint
and overlap. The experimental results demonstrate that our completely weakly
supervised method outperforms even partially weakly supervised methods in the
15-5 VOC and 10-10 VOC settings while achieving competitive accuracy in the
COCO-to-VOC setting.

Conclusion: SynRailObs为铁路安全应用中的障碍物检测提供了重要支持，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Detecting potential obstacles in railway environments is critical for
preventing serious accidents. Identifying a broad range of obstacle categories
under complex conditions requires large-scale datasets with precisely
annotated, high-quality images. However, existing publicly available datasets
fail to meet these requirements, thereby hindering progress in railway safety
research. To address this gap, we introduce SynRailObs, a high-fidelity
synthetic dataset designed to represent a diverse range of weather conditions
and geographical features. Furthermore, diffusion models are employed to
generate rare and difficult-to-capture obstacles that are typically challenging
to obtain in real-world scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of SynRailObs,
we perform experiments in real-world railway environments, testing on both
ballasted and ballastless tracks across various weather conditions. The results
demonstrate that SynRailObs holds substantial potential for advancing obstacle
detection in railway safety applications. Models trained on this dataset show
consistent performance across different distances and environmental conditions.
Moreover, the model trained on SynRailObs exhibits zero-shot capabilities,
which are essential for applications in security-sensitive domains. The data is

TL;DR: EA-3DGS是一种针对户外场景的高质量实时渲染方法，通过自适应四面体网格初始化高斯组件、高效高斯剪枝策略和结构感知的密集化策略，解决了3D高斯泼溅在户外场景中的内存和性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NeRF方法在建筑场景重建中表现优异，但训练和推理速度慢；3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在物体和小场景中表现良好，但在户外场景中因点基显式表示缺乏调整机制和内存限制而受限。

Method: 1. 引入自适应四面体网格初始化高斯组件；2. 提出高效高斯剪枝策略；3. 结构感知密集化策略；4. 使用向量量化减少磁盘空间需求。

Result: 在13个场景（包括公开数据集和自采集场景）上的实验验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: EA-3DGS在户外场景中实现了高质量实时渲染，解决了3DGS的内存和性能问题。

Abstract: Efficient scene representations are essential for many real-world
applications, especially those involving spatial measurement. Although current
NeRF-based methods have achieved impressive results in reconstructing
building-scale scenes, they still suffer from slow training and inference
speeds due to time-consuming stochastic sampling. Recently, 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated excellent performance with its high-quality
rendering and real-time speed, especially for objects and small-scale scenes.
However, in outdoor scenes, its point-based explicit representation lacks an
effective adjustment mechanism, and the millions of Gaussian points required
often lead to memory constraints during training. To address these challenges,
we propose EA-3DGS, a high-quality real-time rendering method designed for
outdoor scenes. First, we introduce a mesh structure to regulate the
initialization of Gaussian components by leveraging an adaptive tetrahedral
mesh that partitions the grid and initializes Gaussian components on each face,
effectively capturing geometric structures in low-texture regions. Second, we
propose an efficient Gaussian pruning strategy that evaluates each 3D
Gaussian's contribution to the view and prunes accordingly. To retain
geometry-critical Gaussian points, we also present a structure-aware
densification strategy that densifies Gaussian points in low-curvature regions.
Additionally, we employ vector quantization for parameter quantization of
Gaussian components, significantly reducing disk space requirements with only a
minimal impact on rendering quality. Extensive experiments on 13 scenes,
including eight from four public datasets (MatrixCity-Aerial, Mill-19, Tanks \&
Temples, WHU) and five self-collected scenes acquired through UAV
photogrammetry measurement from SCUT-CA and plateau regions, further
demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Conclusion: MoCLIP是一种高效且兼容性强的运动生成框架。

Abstract: Human motion generation is essential for fields such as animation, robotics,
and virtual reality, requiring models that effectively capture motion dynamics
from text descriptions. Existing approaches often rely on Contrastive
Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)-based text encoders, but their training on
text-image pairs constrains their ability to understand temporal and kinematic
structures inherent in motion and motion generation. This work introduces
MoCLIP, a fine-tuned CLIP model with an additional motion encoding head,
trained on motion sequences using contrastive learning and tethering loss. By
explicitly incorporating motion-aware representations, MoCLIP enhances motion
fidelity while remaining compatible with existing CLIP-based pipelines and
seamlessly integrating into various CLIP-based methods. Experiments demonstrate
that MoCLIP improves Top-1, Top-2, and Top-3 accuracy while maintaining
competitive FID, leading to improved text-to-motion alignment results. These
results highlight MoCLIP's versatility and effectiveness, establishing it as a
robust framework for enhancing motion generation.

Abstract: Foundation models, pretrained on extensive datasets, have significantly
advanced machine learning by providing robust and transferable embeddings
applicable to various domains, including medical imaging diagnostics. This
study evaluates the utility of embeddings derived from both general-purpose and
medical domain-specific foundation models for training lightweight adapter
models in multi-class radiography classification, focusing specifically on tube
placement assessment. A dataset comprising 8842 radiographs classified into
seven distinct categories was employed to extract embeddings using six
foundation models: DenseNet121, BiomedCLIP, Med-Flamingo, MedImageInsight,
Rad-DINO, and CXR-Foundation. Adapter models were subsequently trained using
classical machine learning algorithms. Among these combinations,
MedImageInsight embeddings paired with an support vector machine adapter
yielded the highest mean area under the curve (mAUC) at 93.8%, followed closely
by Rad-DINO (91.1%) and CXR-Foundation (89.0%). In comparison, BiomedCLIP and
DenseNet121 exhibited moderate performance with mAUC scores of 83.0% and 81.8%,
respectively, whereas Med-Flamingo delivered the lowest performance at 75.1%.
Notably, most adapter models demonstrated computational efficiency, achieving
training within one minute and inference within seconds on CPU, underscoring
their practicality for clinical applications. Furthermore, fairness analyses on
adapters trained on MedImageInsight-derived embeddings indicated minimal
disparities, with gender differences in performance within 2% and standard
deviations across age groups not exceeding 3%. These findings confirm that
foundation model embeddings-especially those from MedImageInsight-facilitate
accurate, computationally efficient, and equitable diagnostic classification
using lightweight adapters for radiographic image analysis.

Abstract: Thermal Infrared (TIR) technology involves the use of sensors to detect and
measure infrared radiation emitted by objects, and it is widely utilized across
a broad spectrum of applications. The advancements in object detection methods
utilizing TIR images have sparked significant research interest. However, most
traditional methods lack the capability to effectively extract and fuse
local-global information, which is crucial for TIR-domain feature attention. In
this study, we present a novel and efficient thermal infrared object detection
framework, known as CRT-YOLO, that is based on centralized feature regulation,
enabling the establishment of global-range interaction on TIR information. Our
proposed model integrates efficient multi-scale attention (EMA) modules, which
adeptly capture long-range dependencies while incurring minimal computational
overhead. Additionally, it leverages the Centralized Feature Pyramid (CFP)
network, which offers global regulation of TIR features. Extensive experiments
conducted on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CRT-YOLO model
significantly outperforms conventional methods for TIR image object detection.
Furthermore, the ablation study provides compelling evidence of the
effectiveness of our proposed modules, reinforcing the potential impact of our
approach on advancing the field of thermal infrared object detection.

Result: 在BOP基准数据集上达到最先进性能，同时保持较高的运行效率。

Conclusion: RefPose通过动态适应新物体形状，实现了对未见物体的鲁棒姿态估计。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of unseen objects from monocular RGB images remains a
challenging problem, especially due to the lack of prior object-specific
knowledge. To tackle this issue, we propose RefPose, an innovative approach to
object pose estimation that leverages a reference image and geometric
correspondence as guidance. RefPose first predicts an initial pose by using
object templates to render the reference image and establish the geometric
correspondence needed for the refinement stage. During the refinement stage,
RefPose estimates the geometric correspondence of the query based on the
generated references and iteratively refines the pose through a
render-and-compare approach. To enhance this estimation, we introduce a
correlation volume-guided attention mechanism that effectively captures
correlations between the query and reference images. Unlike traditional methods
that depend on pre-defined object models, RefPose dynamically adapts to new
object shapes by leveraging a reference image and geometric correspondence.
This results in robust performance across previously unseen objects. Extensive
evaluation on the BOP benchmark datasets shows that RefPose achieves
state-of-the-art results while maintaining a competitive runtime.

Conclusion: 该方法填补了先进机器学习模型与实用辅助设备之间的空白，为视力障碍者提供了更有效的独立导航工具。

Abstract: People with blindness and low vision (pBLV) face significant challenges,
struggling to navigate environments and locate objects due to limited visual
cues. Spatial reasoning is crucial for these individuals, as it enables them to
understand and interpret the spatial relationships in their surroundings,
enhancing their ability to navigate and interact more safely and independently.
Current multi-modal large language (MLLM) models for low vision people lack the
spatial reasoning capabilities needed to effectively assist in these tasks.
Moreover, there is a notable absence of lightweight, easy-to-use systems that
allow pBLV to effectively perceive and interact with their surrounding
environment. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial enhanced multi-modal
large language model based approach for visually impaired individuals. By
fine-tuning the MLLM to incorporate spatial reasoning capabilities, our method
significantly improves the understanding of environmental context, which is
critical for navigation and object recognition. The innovation extends to a
hardware component, designed as an attachment for glasses, ensuring increased
accessibility and ease of use. This integration leverages advanced VLMs to
interpret visual data and provide real-time, spatially aware feedback to the

*Saad Manzur,Bryan Vela,Brandon Vela,Aditya Agrawal,Lan-Anh Dang-Vu,David Li,Wayne Hayes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PoseBench3D框架，用于标准化评估3D人体姿态估计方法在多种数据集上的表现，支持跨数据集比较和分析模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多局限于单一数据集，而实际应用需适应多样化条件，因此需标准化评估方法以提升模型泛化能力。

Method: 构建PoseBench3D框架，统一评估18种方法在四个常用数据集上的表现，支持MPJPE和PA-MPJPE指标，并分析预处理技术的影响。

Result: 生成了100多项跨数据集评估结果，揭示了不同预处理技术对模型性能的影响。

Conclusion: PoseBench3D为3D人体姿态估计提供了标准化评估工具，有助于提升模型在实际场景中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Reliable three-dimensional human pose estimation is becoming increasingly
important for real-world applications, yet much of prior work has focused
solely on the performance within a single dataset. In practice, however,
systems must adapt to diverse viewpoints, environments, and camera setups --
conditions that differ significantly from those encountered during training,
which is often the case in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges,
we present a standardized testing environment in which each method is evaluated
on a variety of datasets, ensuring consistent and fair cross-dataset
comparisons -- allowing for the analysis of methods on previously unseen data.
Therefore, we propose PoseBench3D, a unified framework designed to
systematically re-evaluate prior and future models across four of the most
widely used datasets for human pose estimation -- with the framework able to
support novel and future datasets as the field progresses. Through a unified
interface, our framework provides datasets in a pre-configured yet easily
modifiable format, ensuring compatibility with diverse model architectures. We
re-evaluated the work of 18 methods, either trained or gathered from existing
literature, and reported results using both Mean Per Joint Position Error
(MPJPE) and Procrustes Aligned Mean Per Joint Position Error (PA-MPJPE)
metrics, yielding more than 100 novel cross-dataset evaluation results.
Additionally, we analyze performance differences resulting from various
pre-processing techniques and dataset preparation parameters -- offering
further insight into model generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于4D-CTA的动态心脏模型框架，结合数字孪生技术，为冠状动脉介入提供精确的个性化工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练系统缺乏对心脏生理动态的准确模拟，需要更精确的术前规划和医师培训工具。

Method: 利用4D-CTA数据，构建动态模型，制造透明血管物理模型，并开发心脏输出分析和虚拟血管造影系统。

Result: 虚拟与真实血管造影形态一致性达80.9%，导丝运动轨迹误差低于1.1毫米，透明模型在CABG训练中表现优越。

Conclusion: 患者特定的数字-物理孪生方法有效再现冠状动脉的解剖结构和动态特性，为教育和临床规划提供了动态环境。

Abstract: Background and Objective: Precise preoperative planning and effective
physician training for coronary interventions are increasingly important.
Despite advances in medical imaging technologies, transforming static or
limited dynamic imaging data into comprehensive dynamic cardiac models remains
challenging. Existing training systems lack accurate simulation of cardiac
physiological dynamics. This study develops a comprehensive dynamic cardiac
model research framework based on 4D-CTA, integrating digital twin technology,
computer vision, and physical model manufacturing to provide precise,
personalized tools for interventional cardiology. Methods: Using 4D-CTA data
from a 60-year-old female with three-vessel coronary stenosis, we segmented
cardiac chambers and coronary arteries, constructed dynamic models, and
implemented skeletal skinning weight computation to simulate vessel deformation
across 20 cardiac phases. Transparent vascular physical models were
manufactured using medical-grade silicone. We developed cardiac output analysis
and virtual angiography systems, implemented guidewire 3D reconstruction using
binocular stereo vision, and evaluated the system through angiography
validation and CABG training applications. Results: Morphological consistency
between virtual and real angiography reached 80.9%. Dice similarity
coefficients for guidewire motion ranged from 0.741-0.812, with mean trajectory
errors below 1.1 mm. The transparent model demonstrated advantages in CABG
training, allowing direct visualization while simulating beating heart
challenges. Conclusion: Our patient-specific digital-physical twin approach
effectively reproduces both anatomical structures and dynamic characteristics
of coronary vasculature, offering a dynamic environment with visual and tactile
feedback valuable for education and clinical planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出VISTA方法，通过显式对齐目标解决MLLM中模态对齐偏差问题，显著提升多模态信息融合效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）存在模态对齐偏差，偏向文本信息而忽视视觉等其他模态。

Method: 通过信息论分析交叉熵损失的隐式对齐目标，提出VISTA方法，显式最大化跨模态互信息。

Result: VISTA显著提升现有MLLMs的视觉理解能力，在多个基准数据集上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: VISTA为MLLM模态对齐研究提供了新方向，无需额外模块或数据即可高效实现。

Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face a critical challenge in
modality alignment, often exhibiting a bias towards textual information at the
expense of other modalities like vision. This paper conducts a systematic
information-theoretic analysis of the widely used cross-entropy loss in MLLMs,
uncovering its implicit alignment objective. Our theoretical investigation
reveals that this implicit objective has inherent limitations, leading to a
degradation of cross-modal alignment as text sequence length increases, thereby
hindering effective multimodal information fusion. To overcome these drawbacks,
we propose Vision-Text Alignment (VISTA), a novel approach guided by our
theoretical insights. VISTA introduces an explicit alignment objective designed
to maximize cross-modal mutual information, preventing the degradation of
visual alignment. Notably, VISTA enhances the visual understanding capabilities
of existing MLLMs without requiring any additional trainable modules or extra
training data, making it both efficient and practical. Our method significantly
outperforms baseline models across more than a dozen benchmark datasets,
including VQAv2, MMStar, and MME, paving the way for new directions in MLLM
modal alignment research.

*Junyi Yuan,Jian Zhang,Fangyu Wu,Dongming Lu,Huanda Lu,Qiufeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CulTi的多模态数据集和LACLIP方法，专注于中国文化遗产的跨模态检索，解决了现有数据集的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中国文化遗产包含丰富的多模态信息，但缺乏专门的数据集，限制了跨模态学习模型的发展。

Method: 构建CulTi数据集（5,726对图像-文本），并提出LACLIP方法，基于中文CLIP实现局部对齐。

Result: LACLIP在CulTi数据集上显著优于现有模型，尤其在细粒度语义关联方面表现突出。

Conclusion: CulTi和LACLIP为中国文化遗产的跨模态检索提供了有效工具，填补了领域空白。

Abstract: China has a long and rich history, encompassing a vast cultural heritage that
includes diverse multimodal information, such as silk patterns, Dunhuang
murals, and their associated historical narratives. Cross-modal retrieval plays
a pivotal role in understanding and interpreting Chinese cultural heritage by
bridging visual and textual modalities to enable accurate text-to-image and
image-to-text retrieval. However, despite the growing interest in multimodal
research, there is a lack of specialized datasets dedicated to Chinese cultural
heritage, limiting the development and evaluation of cross-modal learning
models in this domain. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal dataset
named CulTi, which contains 5,726 image-text pairs extracted from two series of
professional documents, respectively related to ancient Chinese silk and
Dunhuang murals. Compared to existing general-domain multimodal datasets, CulTi
presents a challenge for cross-modal retrieval: the difficulty of local
alignment between intricate decorative motifs and specialized textual
descriptions. To address this challenge, we propose LACLIP, a training-free
local alignment strategy built upon a fine-tuned Chinese-CLIP. LACLIP enhances
the alignment of global textual descriptions with local visual regions by
computing weighted similarity scores during inference. Experimental results on
CulTi demonstrate that LACLIP significantly outperforms existing models in
cross-modal retrieval, particularly in handling fine-grained semantic
associations within Chinese cultural heritage.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个光学-SAR融合目标检测的综合数据集M4-SAR，并开发了统一的评测工具包和端到端融合检测框架E2E-OSDet，显著提升了复杂环境下的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光学和SAR图像在复杂环境下的目标检测存在互补优势，但缺乏大规模标准化数据集阻碍了研究进展。

Method: 提出M4-SAR数据集，包含11.2万对齐图像对和近百万标注实例；开发统一评测工具包；提出端到端融合检测框架E2E-OSDet。

Result: 融合光学和SAR数据使mAP提升5.7%，在复杂环境中效果尤为显著。

Conclusion: M4-SAR数据集和E2E-OSDet框架为未来研究提供了标准化基准和强大基线。

Abstract: Single-source remote sensing object detection using optical or SAR images
struggles in complex environments. Optical images offer rich textural details
but are often affected by low-light, cloud-obscured, or low-resolution
conditions, reducing the detection performance. SAR images are robust to
weather, but suffer from speckle noise and limited semantic expressiveness.
Optical and SAR images provide complementary advantages, and fusing them can
significantly improve the detection accuracy. However, progress in this field
is hindered by the lack of large-scale, standardized datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose the first comprehensive dataset for optical-SAR fusion
object detection, named Multi-resolution, Multi-polarization, Multi-scene,
Multi-source SAR dataset (M4-SAR). It contains 112,184 precisely aligned image
pairs and nearly one million labeled instances with arbitrary orientations,
spanning six key categories. To enable standardized evaluation, we develop a
unified benchmarking toolkit that integrates six state-of-the-art multi-source
fusion methods. Furthermore, we propose E2E-OSDet, a novel end-to-end
multi-source fusion detection framework that mitigates cross-domain
discrepancies and establishes a robust baseline for future studies. Extensive
experiments on M4-SAR demonstrate that fusing optical and SAR data can improve
$mAP$ by 5.7\% over single-source inputs, with particularly significant gains
in complex environments. The dataset and code are publicly available at
https://github.com/wchao0601/M4-SAR.

TL;DR: M2AD是一个新的大规模视觉异常检测（VAD）基准数据集，旨在评估VAD方法在视角和光照交互条件下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VAD系统对真实世界成像变化（尤其是视角和光照的复杂交互）的敏感性限制了其实际应用，而当前基准数据集忽视了这一问题。

Method: 通过系统采集10个类别的999个样本，在12个同步视角和10种光照设置下（共120种配置），构建了包含119,880张高分辨率图像的M2AD数据集，并设计了两种评估协议：M2AD-Synergy和M2AD-Invariant。

Result: 实验表明，现有最先进的VAD方法在M2AD上表现显著下降，凸显了视角-光照交互带来的巨大挑战。

Conclusion: M2AD为开发和验证能够应对真实世界复杂性的VAD方法提供了重要工具，数据集和测试套件将公开以推动领域发展。

Abstract: The practical deployment of Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) systems is
hindered by their sensitivity to real-world imaging variations, particularly
the complex interplay between viewpoint and illumination which drastically
alters defect visibility. Current benchmarks largely overlook this critical
challenge. We introduce Multi-View Multi-Illumination Anomaly Detection (M2AD),
a new large-scale benchmark comprising 119,880 high-resolution images designed
explicitly to probe VAD robustness under such interacting conditions. By
systematically capturing 999 specimens across 10 categories using 12
synchronized views and 10 illumination settings (120 configurations total),
M2AD enables rigorous evaluation. We establish two evaluation protocols:
M2AD-Synergy tests the ability to fuse information across diverse
configurations, and M2AD-Invariant measures single-image robustness against
realistic view-illumination effects. Our extensive benchmarking shows that
state-of-the-art VAD methods struggle significantly on M2AD, demonstrating the
profound challenge posed by view-illumination interplay. This benchmark serves
as an essential tool for developing and validating VAD methods capable of
overcoming real-world complexities. Our full dataset and test suite will be
released at https://hustcyq.github.io/M2AD to facilitate the field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为“自条件化”的机制，通过利用去噪网络内部的丰富语义来指导其解码层，从而提升扩散模型的生成质量和特征表示能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像合成中表现出色，但其生成预训练是否能提升模型自身的训练效果，以及特征质量是否能超越自监督学习方法，是本文探讨的核心问题。

Method: 引入自条件化机制，利用去噪网络的语义信息指导解码层，形成更紧密的瓶颈结构，提升生成和表示能力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在生成FID和识别准确率上均有提升，计算开销仅增加1%，且适用于多种扩散架构。

Conclusion: 自条件化机制成功整合了判别性技术（如对比自蒸馏），在不牺牲生成质量的前提下，使扩散模型成为强大的表示学习工具。

Abstract: While diffusion models have gained prominence in image synthesis, their
generative pre-training has been shown to yield discriminative representations,
paving the way towards unified visual generation and understanding. However,
two key questions remain: 1) Can these representations be leveraged to improve
the training of diffusion models themselves, rather than solely benefiting
downstream tasks? 2) Can the feature quality be enhanced to rival or even
surpass modern self-supervised learners, without compromising generative
capability? This work addresses these questions by introducing
self-conditioning, a straightforward yet effective mechanism that internally
leverages the rich semantics inherent in denoising network to guide its own
decoding layers, forming a tighter bottleneck that condenses high-level
semantics to improve generation. Results are compelling: our method boosts both
generation FID and recognition accuracy with 1% computational overhead and
generalizes across diverse diffusion architectures. Crucially,
self-conditioning facilitates an effective integration of discriminative
techniques, such as contrastive self-distillation, directly into diffusion
models without sacrificing generation quality. Extensive experiments on
pixel-space and latent-space datasets show that in linear evaluations, our
enhanced diffusion models, particularly UViT and DiT, serve as strong
representation learners, surpassing various self-supervised models.

Motivation: FIDL领域高度碎片化，缺乏统一基准，导致领域孤岛，阻碍跨领域比较和发展。

Method: 提出模块化架构，分解法证流程为可互换组件；实现10个基线模型、6个主干网络、2个新基准，并整合现有基准。

Result: 通过ForensicHub深入分析，提供了8个关键见解，推动领域发展。

Conclusion: ForensicHub打破了领域孤岛，为FIDL领域的未来发展提供了重要基础。

Abstract: The field of Fake Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) is highly
fragmented, encompassing four domains: deepfake detection (Deepfake), image
manipulation detection and localization (IMDL), artificial
intelligence-generated image detection (AIGC), and document image manipulation
localization (Doc). Although individual benchmarks exist in some domains, a
unified benchmark for all domains in FIDL remains blank. The absence of a
unified benchmark results in significant domain silos, where each domain
independently constructs its datasets, models, and evaluation protocols without
interoperability, preventing cross-domain comparisons and hindering the
development of the entire FIDL field. To close the domain silo barrier, we
propose ForensicHub, the first unified benchmark & codebase for all-domain fake
image detection and localization. Considering drastic variations on dataset,
model, and evaluation configurations across all domains, as well as the
scarcity of open-sourced baseline models and the lack of individual benchmarks
in some domains, ForensicHub: i) proposes a modular and configuration-driven
architecture that decomposes forensic pipelines into interchangeable components
across datasets, transforms, models, and evaluators, allowing flexible
composition across all domains; ii) fully implements 10 baseline models, 6
backbones, 2 new benchmarks for AIGC and Doc, and integrates 2 existing
benchmarks of DeepfakeBench and IMDLBenCo through an adapter-based design; iii)
conducts indepth analysis based on the ForensicHub, offering 8 key actionable
insights into FIDL model architecture, dataset characteristics, and evaluation
standards. ForensicHub represents a significant leap forward in breaking the
domain silos in the FIDL field and inspiring future breakthroughs.

Motivation: 现有方法在分布外运动和精细控制上表现不佳，限制了实际应用。VQVAE方法难以表示新运动，扩散方法缺乏帧级控制。

Method: 提出MoMADiff框架，结合掩码建模与扩散过程，支持用户提供关键帧以实现时空精细控制。

Result: 在多个数据集上，MoMADiff在运动质量、指令忠实度和关键帧遵循方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoMADiff通过结合掩码建模与扩散过程，显著提升了文本到运动的生成能力，尤其在分布外运动和精细控制上表现优异。

Abstract: Generating 3D human motion from text descriptions remains challenging due to
the diverse and complex nature of human motion. While existing methods excel
within the training distribution, they often struggle with out-of-distribution
motions, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Existing
VQVAE-based methods often fail to represent novel motions faithfully using
discrete tokens, which hampers their ability to generalize beyond seen data.
Meanwhile, diffusion-based methods operating on continuous representations
often lack fine-grained control over individual frames. To address these
challenges, we propose a robust motion generation framework MoMADiff, which
combines masked modeling with diffusion processes to generate motion using
frame-level continuous representations. Our model supports flexible
user-provided keyframe specification, enabling precise control over both
spatial and temporal aspects of motion synthesis. MoMADiff demonstrates strong
generalization capability on novel text-to-motion datasets with sparse
keyframes as motion prompts. Extensive experiments on two held-out datasets and
two standard benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models in motion quality, instruction fidelity, and keyframe
adherence.

Motivation: 现有基准测试（如DocVQA和ChartQA）主要基于扫描或数字文档，未能充分反映真实世界中的复杂挑战（如光照变化和物理变形）。

Method: WildDoc包含手动捕获的真实环境文档图像，每份文档在四种不同条件下拍摄，并利用现有基准测试的文档源进行对比。

Result: 评估显示，现有MLLMs在WildDoc上性能显著下降，模型鲁棒性不足。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced capabilities in Document Understanding. However,
prevailing benchmarks like DocVQA and ChartQA predominantly comprise
\textit{scanned or digital} documents, inadequately reflecting the intricate
challenges posed by diverse real-world scenarios, such as variable illumination
and physical distortions. This paper introduces WildDoc, the inaugural
benchmark designed specifically for assessing document understanding in natural
environments. WildDoc incorporates a diverse set of manually captured document
images reflecting real-world conditions and leverages document sources from
established benchmarks to facilitate comprehensive comparisons with digital or
scanned documents. Further, to rigorously evaluate model robustness, each
document is captured four times under different conditions. Evaluations of
state-of-the-art MLLMs on WildDoc expose substantial performance declines and
underscore the models' inadequate robustness compared to traditional
benchmarks, highlighting the unique challenges posed by real-world document
understanding. Our project homepage is available at

Conclusion: DTSL框架通过双师生学习和CLG，显著提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation has attracted significant
attention due to its potential to reduce manual annotation costs. The mean
teacher (MT) strategy, commonly understood as introducing smoothed, temporally
lagged consistency regularization, has demonstrated strong performance across
various tasks in this field. In this work, we reinterpret the MT strategy on
supervised data as a form of self-paced learning, regulated by the output
agreement between the temporally lagged teacher model and the ground truth
labels. This idea is further extended to incorporate agreement between a
temporally lagged model and a cross-architectural model, which offers greater
flexibility in regulating the learning pace and enables application to
unlabeled data. Specifically, we propose dual teacher-student learning (DTSL),
a framework that introduces two groups of teacher-student models with different
architectures. The output agreement between the cross-group teacher and student
models is used as pseudo-labels, generated via a Jensen-Shannon
divergence-based consensus label generator (CLG). Extensive experiments on
popular datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
existing state-of-the-art approaches. Ablation studies further validate the
effectiveness of the proposed modules.

Abstract: Determining the shelf life quality of pineapples using non-destructive
methods is a crucial step to reduce waste and increase income. In this paper, a
multimodal and multiview classification model was constructed to classify
pineapples into four quality levels based on audio and visual characteristics.
For research purposes, we compiled and released the PQC500 dataset consisting
of 500 pineapples with two modalities: one was tapping pineapples to record
sounds by multiple microphones and the other was taking pictures by multiple
cameras at different locations, providing multimodal and multi-view audiovisual
features. We modified the contrastive audiovisual masked autoencoder to train
the cross-modal-based classification model by abundant combinations of audio
and visual pairs. In addition, we proposed to sample a compact size of training
data for efficient computation. The experiments were evaluated under various
data and model configurations, and the results demonstrated that the proposed
cross-modal model trained using audio-major sampling can yield 84% accuracy,
outperforming the unimodal models of only audio and only visual by 6% and 18%,
respectively.

Abstract: Robust machine learning depends on clean data, yet current image data
cleaning benchmarks rely on synthetic noise or narrow human studies, limiting
comparison and real-world relevance. We introduce CleanPatrick, the first
large-scale benchmark for data cleaning in the image domain, built upon the
publicly available Fitzpatrick17k dermatology dataset. We collect 496,377
binary annotations from 933 medical crowd workers, identify off-topic samples
(4%), near-duplicates (21%), and label errors (22%), and employ an aggregation
model inspired by item-response theory followed by expert review to derive
high-quality ground truth. CleanPatrick formalizes issue detection as a ranking
task and adopts typical ranking metrics mirroring real audit workflows.
Benchmarking classical anomaly detectors, perceptual hashing, SSIM, Confident
Learning, NoiseRank, and SelfClean, we find that, on CleanPatrick,
self-supervised representations excel at near-duplicate detection, classical
methods achieve competitive off-topic detection under constrained review
budgets, and label-error detection remains an open challenge for fine-grained
medical classification. By releasing both the dataset and the evaluation
framework, CleanPatrick enables a systematic comparison of image-cleaning
strategies and paves the way for more reliable data-centric artificial

Abstract: Street view data is increasingly being used in computer vision applications

idiosyncracies, such as city layout, may lead to biases in street view data for
28 cities across the globe, even when they are densely covered. We
quantitatively uncover biases in the distribution of coverage of street view
data and propose a method for evaluation of such distributions to get better
insight in idiosyncracies in a cities' coverage. In addition, we perform a case
study of Amsterdam with semi-structured interviews, showing how idiosyncracies
of the collection process impact representation of cities and regions and
allowing us to address biases at their source.

TL;DR: CUBIC是一种无需预定义偏差概念或失败样本的自动方法，通过图像-文本潜在空间和线性分类器探针，识别可能影响模型预测的可解释概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度视觉模型常依赖数据集中的虚假相关性学习偏差，而现有方法需要大量人工标注。CUBIC旨在自动发现这些偏差，减少人工标注需求。

Method: CUBIC利用图像-文本潜在空间和线性分类器探针，分析超类标签的潜在表示如何受特定概念影响，并通过决策边界法向量测量偏差。

Result: 实验表明，CUBIC能有效发现未知偏差，无需预知偏差或模型失败样本。

Conclusion: CUBIC为自动识别模型偏差提供了一种高效且无需人工干预的方法。

Abstract: Deep vision models often rely on biases learned from spurious correlations in
datasets. To identify these biases, methods that interpret high-level,
human-understandable concepts are more effective than those relying primarily
on low-level features like heatmaps. A major challenge for these concept-based
methods is the lack of image annotations indicating potentially bias-inducing
concepts, since creating such annotations requires detailed labeling for each
dataset and concept, which is highly labor-intensive. We present CUBIC (Concept
embeddings for Unsupervised Bias IdentifiCation), a novel method that
automatically discovers interpretable concepts that may bias classifier
behavior. Unlike existing approaches, CUBIC does not rely on predefined bias
candidates or examples of model failures tied to specific biases, as such
information is not always available. Instead, it leverages image-text latent
space and linear classifier probes to examine how the latent representation of
a superclass label$\unicode{x2014}$shared by all instances in the
dataset$\unicode{x2014}$is influenced by the presence of a given concept. By
measuring these shifts against the normal vector to the classifier's decision
boundary, CUBIC identifies concepts that significantly influence model
predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that CUBIC effectively uncovers
previously unknown biases using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without requiring
the samples in the dataset where the classifier underperforms or prior
knowledge of potential biases.

TL;DR: HSRMamba通过条带扫描和小波分解改进Visual Mamba，减少伪影并提升超分辨率性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Visual Mamba在单高光谱图像超分辨率任务中因单向扫描导致的伪影问题。

Method: 引入条带扫描方案和小波分解，平衡计算效率和特征模态冲突。

Result: 实验表明HSRMamba在计算负载和性能上均优于现有方法，达到SOTA。

Conclusion: HSRMamba在保持高效的同时显著提升了超分辨率效果。

Abstract: Single hyperspectral image super-resolution (SHSR) aims to restore
high-resolution images from low-resolution hyperspectral images. Recently, the
Visual Mamba model has achieved an impressive balance between performance and
computational efficiency. However, due to its 1D scanning paradigm, the model
may suffer from potential artifacts during image generation. To address this
issue, we propose HSRMamba. While maintaining the computational efficiency of
Visual Mamba, we introduce a strip-based scanning scheme to effectively reduce
artifacts from global unidirectional scanning. Additionally, HSRMamba uses
wavelet decomposition to alleviate modal conflicts between high-frequency
spatial features and low-frequency spectral features, further improving
super-resolution performance. Extensive experiments show that HSRMamba not only
excels in reducing computational load and model size but also outperforms
existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: 论文提出Group Preference Optimization (GPO)，通过扩展DPO为组偏好优化并引入奖励标准化，解决了DPO在T2I模型中对偏好对敏感和数据标注耗时的问题，显著提升了生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO在T2I模型中面临偏好对敏感和数据标注耗时的问题，且可能因忽略绝对差异而误分类样本。

Method: 扩展DPO为组偏好优化（GPO），引入奖励标准化重新加权，无需显式数据选择。

Result: GPO显著提升了Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium的计数和文本渲染能力20个百分点，且推理时无额外开销。

Conclusion: GPO是一种高效的自改进方法，适用于多种扩散模型和任务，无需外部数据。

Abstract: Aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) has shown notable improvements in generation quality.
However, applying DPO to T2I faces two challenges: the sensitivity of DPO to
preference pairs and the labor-intensive process of collecting and annotating
high-quality data. In this work, we demonstrate that preference pairs with
marginal differences can degrade DPO performance. Since DPO relies exclusively
on relative ranking while disregarding the absolute difference of pairs, it may
misclassify losing samples as wins, or vice versa. We empirically show that
extending the DPO from pairwise to groupwise and incorporating reward
standardization for reweighting leads to performance gains without explicit
data selection. Furthermore, we propose Group Preference Optimization (GPO), an
effective self-improvement method that enhances performance by leveraging the
model's own capabilities without requiring external data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that GPO is effective across various diffusion models and tasks.
Specifically, combining with widely used computer vision models, such as YOLO
and OCR, the GPO improves the accurate counting and text rendering capabilities
of the Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium by 20 percentage points. Notably, as a
plug-and-play method, no extra overhead is introduced during inference.

Motivation: 半监督实例分割中，伪标签的类别和掩码质量不平衡导致性能不稳定，现有方法通过单一阈值过滤伪标签，难以兼顾两者质量。

Method: 提出PL-DC框架，包括实例级的双阈值过滤机制、类别级的动态类别校正模块和像素级的掩码不确定性加权机制。

Result: 在COCO和Cityscapes数据集上，PL-DC显著提升了性能，尤其在少量标注数据下表现突出（如1% COCO数据提升11.6 mAP）。

Conclusion: PL-DC通过解耦和校正伪标签质量，有效解决了半监督实例分割中的性能不稳定问题，并实现了新的最优结果。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Instance Segmentation (SSIS) involves classifying and
grouping image pixels into distinct object instances using limited labeled
data. This learning paradigm usually faces a significant challenge of unstable
performance caused by noisy pseudo-labels of instance categories and pixel
masks. We find that the prevalent practice of filtering instance pseudo-labels
assessing both class and mask quality with a single score threshold, frequently
leads to compromises in the trade-off between the qualities of class and mask
labels. In this paper, we introduce a novel Pseudo-Label Quality Decoupling and
Correction (PL-DC) framework for SSIS to tackle the above challenges. Firstly,
at the instance level, a decoupled dual-threshold filtering mechanism is
designed to decouple class and mask quality estimations for instance-level
pseudo-labels, thereby independently controlling pixel classifying and grouping
qualities. Secondly, at the category level, we introduce a dynamic instance
category correction module to dynamically correct the pseudo-labels of instance
categories, effectively alleviating category confusion. Lastly, we introduce a
pixel-level mask uncertainty-aware mechanism at the pixel level to re-weight
the mask loss for different pixels, thereby reducing the impact of noise
introduced by pixel-level mask pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on the COCO
and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that the proposed PL-DC achieves
significant performance improvements, setting new state-of-the-art results for
SSIS. Notably, our PL-DC shows substantial gains even with minimal labeled
data, achieving an improvement of +11.6 mAP with just 1% COCO labeled data and
+15.5 mAP with 5% Cityscapes labeled data. The code will be public.

Conclusion: Hybrid-Emba3D通过几何-特征耦合和跨路径混合，显著提升了点云分类性能，为高效局部特征提取提供了新思路。

Abstract: The point cloud classification tasks face the dual challenge of efficiently
extracting local geometric features while maintaining model complexity. The
Mamba architecture utilizes the linear complexity advantage of state space
models (SSMs) to overcome the computational bottleneck of Transformers while
balancing global modeling capabilities. However, the inherent contradiction
between its unidirectional dependency and the unordered nature of point clouds
impedes modeling spatial correlation in local neighborhoods, thus constraining
geometric feature extraction. This paper proposes Hybrid-Emba3D, a
bidirectional Mamba model enhanced by geometry-feature coupling and cross-path
feature hybridization. The Local geometric pooling with geometry-feature
coupling mechanism significantly enhances local feature discriminative power
via coordinated propagation and dynamic aggregation of geometric information
between local center points and their neighborhoods, without introducing
additional parameters. The designed Collaborative feature enhancer adopts
dual-path hybridization, effectively handling local mutations and sparse key
signals, breaking through the limitations of traditional SSM long-range
modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a
new SOTA classification accuracy of 95.99% on ModelNet40 with only 0.03M
additional.

Abstract: Synthetic media generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) pose
significant challenges in verifying authenticity and tracing dataset origins,
raising critical concerns in copyright enforcement, privacy protection, and
legal compliance. This paper introduces a novel forensic framework for
identifying the training dataset (e.g., CelebA or FFHQ) of GAN-generated images
through interpretable feature analysis. By integrating spectral transforms
(Fourier/DCT), color distribution metrics, and local feature descriptors
(SIFT), our pipeline extracts discriminative statistical signatures embedded in
synthetic outputs. Supervised classifiers (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost) achieve
98-99% accuracy in binary classification (real vs. synthetic) and multi-class
dataset attribution across diverse GAN architectures (StyleGAN, AttGAN, GDWCT,
StarGAN, and StyleGAN2). Experimental results highlight the dominance of
frequency-domain features (DCT/FFT) in capturing dataset-specific artifacts,
such as upsampling patterns and spectral irregularities, while color histograms
reveal implicit regularization strategies in GAN training. We further examine
legal and ethical implications, showing how dataset attribution can address
copyright infringement, unauthorized use of personal data, and regulatory
compliance under frameworks like GDPR and California's AB 602. Our framework
advances accountability and governance in generative modeling, with
applications in digital forensics, content moderation, and intellectual
property litigation.

Conclusion: 根据任务需求和资源限制选择合适技术，代码已公开。

Abstract: The development of foundation models through pretraining of vision-language
models (VLMs) has recently attracted great attention in remote sensing (RS).
VLM pretraining aims to learn image and language alignments from a large number
of image-text pairs. Each pretraining image is often associated with multiple
captions containing redundant information due to repeated or semantically
similar phrases, resulting in increased pretraining and inference time. To
overcome this, we introduce a weighted feature aggregation (WFA) strategy for
VLM pretraining in RS. Our strategy aims to extract and exploit complementary
information from multiple captions per image while reducing redundancies
through feature aggregation with importance weighting. To calculate adaptive
importance weights for different captions of each image, we propose two
techniques: (i) non-parametric uniqueness and (ii) learning-based attention. In
the first technique, importance weights are calculated based on the bilingual
evaluation understudy (BLEU) scores of the captions to emphasize unique
sentences and reduce the influence of repetitive ones. In the second technique,
importance weights are learned through an attention mechanism instead of
relying on hand-crafted features. The effectiveness of the proposed WFA
strategy with the two techniques is analyzed in terms of downstream performance
on text-to-image retrieval in RS. Experimental results show that the proposed
strategy enables efficient and effective pretraining of VLMs in RS. Based on
the experimental analysis, we derive guidelines for selecting appropriate
techniques depending on downstream task requirements and resource constraints.

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have revolutionized
computer vision through innovative architectures and learning objectives, yet
they have not fully leveraged insights from biological visual processing
systems. Recently, a brain-inspired SSL model named PhiNet was proposed; it is
based on a ResNet backbone and operates on static image inputs with strong
augmentation. In this paper, we introduce PhiNet v2, a novel Transformer-based
architecture that processes temporal visual input (that is, sequences of
images) without relying on strong augmentation. Our model leverages variational
inference to learn robust visual representations from continuous input streams,
similar to human visual processing. Through extensive experimentation, we
demonstrate that PhiNet v2 achieves competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art vision foundation models, while maintaining the ability to
learn from sequential input without strong data augmentation. This work
represents a significant step toward more biologically plausible computer
vision systems that process visual information in a manner more closely aligned
with human cognitive processes.

Conclusion: Co-Erasing通过视觉监督有效解决了文本与图像模态间的知识鸿沟问题，提升了概念擦除的效能与实用性。

Abstract: Concept erasing has recently emerged as an effective paradigm to prevent
text-to-image diffusion models from generating visually undesirable or even
harmful content. However, current removal methods heavily rely on manually
crafted text prompts, making it challenging to achieve a high erasure
(efficacy) while minimizing the impact on other benign concepts (usability). In
this paper, we attribute the limitations to the inherent gap between the text
and image modalities, which makes it hard to transfer the intricately entangled
concept knowledge from text prompts to the image generation process. To address
this, we propose a novel solution by directly integrating visual supervision
into the erasure process, introducing the first text-image Collaborative
Concept Erasing (Co-Erasing) framework. Specifically, Co-Erasing describes the
concept jointly by text prompts and the corresponding undesirable images
induced by the prompts, and then reduces the generating probability of the
target concept through negative guidance. This approach effectively bypasses
the knowledge gap between text and image, significantly enhancing erasure
efficacy. Additionally, we design a text-guided image concept refinement
strategy that directs the model to focus on visual features most relevant to
the specified text concept, minimizing disruption to other benign concepts.
Finally, comprehensive experiments suggest that Co-Erasing outperforms
state-of-the-art erasure approaches significantly with a better trade-off
between efficacy and usability. Codes are available at

Abstract: The goal of achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is to imitate
humans and surpass them. Models such as OpenAI's o1, o3, and DeepSeek's R1 have
demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) with human-like reasoning
capabilities exhibit exceptional performance and are being gradually integrated
into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, whether these models
possess capabilities comparable to humans in handling reasoning tasks remains
unclear at present. In this paper, we propose Human-Aligned Bench, a benchmark
for fine-grained alignment of multimodal reasoning with human performance.
Specifically, we collected 9,794 multimodal questions that solely rely on
contextual reasoning, including bilingual (Chinese and English) multimodal
questions and pure text-based questions, encompassing four question types:
visual reasoning, definition judgment, analogical reasoning, and logical
judgment. More importantly, each question is accompanied by human success rates
and options that humans are prone to choosing incorrectly. Extensive
experiments on the Human-Aligned Bench reveal notable differences between the
performance of current MLLMs in multimodal reasoning and human performance. The
findings on our benchmark provide insights into the development of the
next-generation models.

Abstract: Hands are essential to human interaction, and understanding contact between
hands and the world can promote comprehensive understanding of their function.
Recently, there have been growing number of hand interaction datasets that
cover interaction with object, other hand, scene, and body. Despite the
significance of the task and increasing high-quality data, how to effectively
learn dense hand contact estimation remains largely underexplored. There are
two major challenges for learning dense hand contact estimation. First, there
exists class imbalance issue from hand contact datasets where majority of
samples are not in contact. Second, hand contact datasets contain spatial
imbalance issue with most of hand contact exhibited in finger tips, resulting
in challenges for generalization towards contacts in other hand regions. To
tackle these issues, we present a framework that learns dense HAnd COntact
estimation (HACO) from imbalanced data. To resolve the class imbalance issue,
we introduce balanced contact sampling, which builds and samples from multiple
sampling groups that fairly represent diverse contact statistics for both
contact and non-contact samples. Moreover, to address the spatial imbalance
issue, we propose vertex-level class-balanced (VCB) loss, which incorporates
spatially varying contact distribution by separately reweighting loss
contribution of each vertex based on its contact frequency across dataset. As a
result, we effectively learn to predict dense hand contact estimation with
large-scale hand contact data without suffering from class and spatial
imbalance issue. The codes will be released.

Abstract: State-of-the-art T2I models are capable of generating high-resolution images
given textual prompts. However, they still struggle with accurately depicting
compositional scenes that specify multiple objects, attributes, and spatial
relations. We present CompAlign, a challenging benchmark with an emphasis on
assessing the depiction of 3D-spatial relationships, for evaluating and
improving models on compositional image generation. CompAlign consists of 900
complex multi-subject image generation prompts that combine numerical and
3D-spatial relationships with varied attribute bindings. Our benchmark is
remarkably challenging, incorporating generation tasks with 3+ generation
subjects with complex 3D-spatial relationships. Additionally, we propose
CompQuest, an interpretable and accurate evaluation framework that decomposes
complex prompts into atomic sub-questions, then utilizes a MLLM to provide
fine-grained binary feedback on the correctness of each aspect of generation
elements in model-generated images. This enables precise quantification of
alignment between generated images and compositional prompts. Furthermore, we
propose an alignment framework that uses CompQuest's feedback as preference
signals to improve diffusion models' compositional image generation abilities.
Using adjustable per-image preferences, our method is easily scalable and
flexible for different tasks. Evaluation of 9 T2I models reveals that: (1)
models remarkable struggle more with compositional tasks with more complex
3D-spatial configurations, and (2) a noticeable performance gap exists between
open-source accessible models and closed-source commercial models. Further
empirical study on using CompAlign for model alignment yield promising results:

Abstract: In incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC), missing data induce prototype
shifts within views and semantic inconsistencies across views. A feasible
solution is to explore cross-view consistency in paired complete observations,
further imputing and aligning the similarity relationships inherently shared
across views. Nevertheless, existing methods are constrained by two-tiered
limitations: (1) Neither instance- nor cluster-level consistency learning
construct a semantic space shared across views to learn consensus semantics.
The former enforces cross-view instances alignment, and wrongly regards
unpaired observations with semantic consistency as negative pairs; the latter
focuses on cross-view cluster counterparts while coarsely handling fine-grained
intra-cluster relationships within views. (2) Excessive reliance on consistency
results in unreliable imputation and alignment without incorporating
view-specific cluster information. Thus, we propose an IMVC framework,
imputation- and alignment-free for consensus semantics learning (FreeCSL). To
bridge semantic gaps across all observations, we learn consensus prototypes
from available data to discover a shared space, where semantically similar
observations are pulled closer for consensus semantics learning. To capture
semantic relationships within specific views, we design a heuristic graph
clustering based on modularity to recover cluster structure with intra-cluster
compactness and inter-cluster separation for cluster semantics enhancement.
Extensive experiments demonstrate, compared to state-of-the-art competitors,
FreeCSL achieves more confident and robust assignments on IMVC task.

TL;DR: FALCON是一种自适应平衡硬负样本和假负样本的学习策略，用于视觉语言预训练（VLP），通过动态选择负样本提升跨模态对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假负样本在VLP中导致冲突的监督信号，影响嵌入空间和硬负采样的效果。

Method: 提出FALCON，基于学习的mini-batch构建策略，动态选择负样本，平衡硬负和假负样本。

Result: FALCON显著提升了ALBEF和BLIP-2框架的性能，并在多种下游任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: FALCON有效缓解假负样本的影响，提升了VLP的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: False negatives pose a critical challenge in vision-language pretraining
(VLP) due to the many-to-many correspondence between images and texts in
large-scale datasets. These false negatives introduce conflicting supervision
signals that degrade the learned embedding space and diminish the effectiveness
of hard negative sampling. In this paper, we propose FALCON (False-negative
Aware Learning of COntrastive Negatives), a learning-based mini-batch
construction strategy that adaptively balances the trade-off between hard and
false negatives during VLP. Rather than relying on fixed heuristics, FALCON
employs a negative mining scheduler that dynamically selects negative samples
of appropriate hardness for each anchor instance during mini-batch
construction, guided by a proxy for cross-modal alignment improvement.
Experimental results demonstrate that FALCON significantly improves performance
across two widely adopted VLP frameworks (ALBEF, BLIP-2) and a broad range of
downstream tasks and evaluation settings, underscoring its effectiveness and
robustness in mitigating the impact of false negatives.

Motivation: DiT模型在视觉生成中表现优异但计算成本高，研究发现其全局自注意力冗余，探索卷积作为更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出Diffusion ConvNet (DiCo)，用标准卷积模块构建扩散模型，引入紧凑通道注意力机制以减少通道冗余。

Result: DiCo在ImageNet基准测试中，图像质量和生成速度均优于DiT，DiCo-XL在256x256和512x512分辨率下FID分别为2.05和2.53，速度提升2.7x和3.1x。DiCo-H（1B参数）FID达1.90。

Conclusion: DiCo通过卷积和紧凑通道注意力机制，实现了高效且高性能的扩散模型，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT), a promising diffusion model for visual
generation, demonstrates impressive performance but incurs significant
computational overhead. Intriguingly, analysis of pre-trained DiT models
reveals that global self-attention is often redundant, predominantly capturing
local patterns-highlighting the potential for more efficient alternatives. In
this paper, we revisit convolution as an alternative building block for
constructing efficient and expressive diffusion models. However, naively
replacing self-attention with convolution typically results in degraded
performance. Our investigations attribute this performance gap to the higher
channel redundancy in ConvNets compared to Transformers. To resolve this, we
introduce a compact channel attention mechanism that promotes the activation of
more diverse channels, thereby enhancing feature diversity. This leads to
Diffusion ConvNet (DiCo), a family of diffusion models built entirely from
standard ConvNet modules, offering strong generative performance with
significant efficiency gains. On class-conditional ImageNet benchmarks, DiCo
outperforms previous diffusion models in both image quality and generation
speed. Notably, DiCo-XL achieves an FID of 2.05 at 256x256 resolution and 2.53
at 512x512, with a 2.7x and 3.1x speedup over DiT-XL/2, respectively.
Furthermore, our largest model, DiCo-H, scaled to 1B parameters, reaches an FID
of 1.90 on ImageNet 256x256-without any additional supervision during training.

Motivation: 在非线性流形中，传统距离度量难以区分语义不同的高相似样本，测地距离能更可靠地衡量样本间关系。

Method: 通过构建图结构表示样本邻接关系，应用最短路径算法计算测地距离，并提出分层图结构和增量更新策略以提高效率。

Result: 多任务实验验证了方法的有效性，能够捕捉样本间复杂关系并提升多模态学习性能。

Conclusion: 测地距离在多模态学习中表现出色，为非线性空间中的样本关系建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Geodesic distance serves as a reliable means of measuring distance in
nonlinear spaces, and such nonlinear manifolds are prevalent in the current
multimodal learning. In these scenarios, some samples may exhibit high
similarity, yet they convey different semantics, making traditional distance
metrics inadequate for distinguishing between positive and negative samples.
This paper introduces geodesic distance as a novel distance metric in
multi-modal learning for the first time, to mine correlations between samples,
aiming to address the limitations of common distance metric. Our approach
incorporates a comprehensive series of strategies to adapt geodesic distance
for the current multimodal learning. Specifically, we construct a graph
structure to represent the adjacency relationships among samples by
thresholding distances between them and then apply the shortest-path algorithm
to obtain geodesic distance within this graph. To facilitate efficient
computation, we further propose a hierarchical graph structure through
clustering and combined with incremental update strategies for dynamic status
updates. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks validate the
effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating its capability to capture
complex relationships between samples and improve the performance of multimodal
learning models.

Conclusion: 该方法有效去噪并保留关键特征，显著提升了事件相机的物体识别性能。

Abstract: Event cameras, which capture brightness changes with high temporal
resolution, inherently generate a significant amount of redundant and noisy
data beyond essential object structures. The primary challenge in event-based
object recognition lies in effectively removing this noise without losing
critical spatial-temporal information. To address this, we propose an Adaptive
Graph-based Noisy Data Removal framework for Event-based Object Recognition.
Specifically, our approach integrates adaptive event segmentation based on
normalized density analysis, a multifactorial edge-weighting mechanism, and
adaptive graph-based denoising strategies. These innovations significantly
enhance the integration of spatiotemporal information, effectively filtering
noise while preserving critical structural features for robust recognition.
Experimental evaluations on four challenging datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves superior recognition accuracies of 83.77%, 76.79%, 99.30%, and
96.89%, surpassing existing graph-based methods by up to 8.79%, and improving
noise reduction performance by up to 19.57%, with an additional accuracy gain
of 6.26% compared to traditional Euclidean-based techniques.

Conclusion: 通过处理负面偏好，有效提升扩散模型的生成质量和对齐能力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have made substantial advances in image generation, yet
models trained on large, unfiltered datasets often yield outputs misaligned
with human preferences. Numerous methods have been proposed to fine-tune
pre-trained diffusion models, achieving notable improvements in aligning
generated outputs with human preferences. However, we argue that existing
preference alignment methods neglect the critical role of handling
unconditional/negative-conditional outputs, leading to a diminished capacity to
avoid generating undesirable outcomes. This oversight limits the efficacy of
classifier-free guidance~(CFG), which relies on the contrast between
conditional generation and unconditional/negative-conditional generation to
optimize output quality. In response, we propose a straightforward but
versatile effective approach that involves training a model specifically
attuned to negative preferences. This method does not require new training
strategies or datasets but rather involves minor modifications to existing
techniques. Our approach integrates seamlessly with models such as SD1.5, SDXL,
video diffusion models and models that have undergone preference optimization,
consistently enhancing their alignment with human preferences.

Conclusion: 本文为无监督图像增强提供了新方向，特别适用于语义一致性要求高的场景。

Abstract: Image enhancement methods often prioritize pixel level information,
overlooking the semantic features. We propose a novel, unsupervised,
fuzzy-inspired image enhancement framework guided by NSGA-II algorithm that
optimizes image brightness, contrast, and gamma parameters to achieve a balance
between visual quality and semantic fidelity. Central to our proposed method is
the use of a pre trained deep neural network as a feature extractor. To find
the best enhancement settings, we use a GPU-accelerated NSGA-II algorithm that
balances multiple objectives, namely, increasing image entropy, improving
perceptual similarity, and maintaining appropriate brightness. We further
improve the results by applying a local search phase to fine-tune the top
candidates from the genetic algorithm. Our approach operates entirely without
paired training data making it broadly applicable across domains with limited
or noisy labels. Quantitatively, our model achieves excellent performance with
average BRISQUE and NIQE scores of 19.82 and 3.652, respectively, in all
unpaired datasets. Qualitatively, enhanced images by our model exhibit
significantly improved visibility in shadowed regions, natural balance of
contrast and also preserve the richer fine detail without introducing noticable
artifacts. This work opens new directions for unsupervised image enhancement
where semantic consistency is critical.

Conclusion: DRAGON为合成内容检测和溯源技术提供了全面的支持，有助于应对快速发展的扩散模型挑战。

Abstract: The remarkable ease of use of diffusion models for image generation has led
to a proliferation of synthetic content online. While these models are often
employed for legitimate purposes, they are also used to generate fake images
that support misinformation and hate speech. Consequently, it is crucial to
develop robust tools capable of detecting whether an image has been generated
by such models. Many current detection methods, however, require large volumes
of sample images for training. Unfortunately, due to the rapid evolution of the
field, existing datasets often cover only a limited range of models and quickly
become outdated. In this work, we introduce DRAGON, a comprehensive dataset
comprising images from 25 diffusion models, spanning both recent advancements
and older, well-established architectures. The dataset contains a broad variety
of images representing diverse subjects. To enhance image realism, we propose a
simple yet effective pipeline that leverages a large language model to expand
input prompts, thereby generating more diverse and higher-quality outputs, as
evidenced by improvements in standard quality metrics. The dataset is provided
in multiple sizes (ranging from extra-small to extra-large) to accomodate
different research scenarios. DRAGON is designed to support the forensic
community in developing and evaluating detection and attribution techniques for
synthetic content. Additionally, the dataset is accompanied by a dedicated test
set, intended to serve as a benchmark for assessing the performance of newly
developed methods.

Conclusion: MV-DeepSimNets通过几何预条件处理和多视图相似性学习，显著提升了多视图重建效果，且易于集成到现有软件中。

Abstract: We introduce MV-DeepSimNets, a comprehensive suite of deep neural networks
designed for multi-view similarity learning, leveraging epipolar geometry for
training. Our approach incorporates an online geometry prior to characterize
pixel relationships, either along the epipolar line or through homography
rectification. This enables the generation of geometry-aware features from
native images, which are then projected across candidate depth hypotheses using
plane sweeping. Our method geometric preconditioning effectively adapts
epipolar-based features for enhanced multi-view reconstruction, without
requiring the laborious multi-view training dataset creation. By aggregating
learned similarities, we construct and regularize the cost volume, leading to
improved multi-view surface reconstruction over traditional dense matching
approaches. MV-DeepSimNets demonstrates superior performance against leading
similarity learning networks and end-to-end regression models, especially in
terms of generalization capabilities across both aerial and satellite imagery
with varied ground sampling distances. Our pipeline is integrated into MicMac
software and can be readily adopted in standard multi-resolution image matching
pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像表示中存在复杂的非均匀性问题，现有模型假设维度同质性导致性能不佳，FairHyp旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FairHyp包含三个模块：Runge-Kutta启发的空间适配器、多感受野卷积模块和光谱上下文状态空间模型，分别处理空间、特征和光谱的非均匀性。

Result: 在分类、去噪、超分辨率和修复等任务中，FairHyp均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FairHyp重新定义了HSI建模中的公平性，为高维视觉任务提供了平衡适应性、效率和保真度的新范式。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) representation is fundamentally challenged by
pervasive non-uniformity, where spectral dependencies, spatial continuity, and
feature efficiency exhibit complex and often conflicting behaviors. Most
existing models rely on a unified processing paradigm that assumes homogeneity
across dimensions, leading to suboptimal performance and biased
representations. To address this, we propose FairHyp, a fairness-directed
framework that explicitly disentangles and resolves the threefold
non-uniformity through cooperative yet specialized modules. We introduce a
Runge-Kutta-inspired spatial variability adapter to restore spatial coherence
under resolution discrepancies, a multi-receptive field convolution module with
sparse-aware refinement to enhance discriminative features while respecting
inherent sparsity, and a spectral-context state space model that captures
stable and long-range spectral dependencies via bidirectional Mamba scanning
and statistical aggregation. Unlike one-size-fits-all solutions, FairHyp
achieves dimension-specific adaptation while preserving global consistency and
mutual reinforcement. This design is grounded in the view that non-uniformity
arises from the intrinsic structure of HSI representations, rather than any
particular task setting. To validate this, we apply FairHyp across four
representative tasks including classification, denoising, super-resolution, and
inpaintin, demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling a shared structural
flaw. Extensive experiments show that FairHyp consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods under varied imaging conditions. Our findings redefine
fairness as a structural necessity in HSI modeling and offer a new paradigm for
balancing adaptability, efficiency, and fidelity in high-dimensional vision
tasks.

Abstract: Mobile robots are reaching unprecedented speeds, with platforms like Unitree
B2, and Fraunhofer O3dyn achieving maximum speeds between 5 and 10 m/s.
However, effectively utilizing such speeds remains a challenge due to the
limitations of RGB cameras, which suffer from motion blur and fail to provide
real-time responsiveness. Event cameras, with their asynchronous operation, and
low-latency sensing, offer a promising alternative for high-speed robotic
perception. In this work, we introduce MTevent, a dataset designed for 6D pose
estimation and moving object detection in highly dynamic environments with
large detection distances. Our setup consists of a stereo-event camera and an
RGB camera, capturing 75 scenes, each on average 16 seconds, and featuring 16
unique objects under challenging conditions such as extreme viewing angles,
varying lighting, and occlusions. MTevent is the first dataset to combine
high-speed motion, long-range perception, and real-world object interactions,
making it a valuable resource for advancing event-based vision in robotics. To
establish a baseline, we evaluate the task of 6D pose estimation using NVIDIA's
FoundationPose on RGB images, achieving an Average Recall of 0.22 with
ground-truth masks, highlighting the limitations of RGB-based approaches in
such dynamic settings. With MTevent, we provide a novel resource to improve

Conclusion: B3方法通过优化批量构建策略，显著提升了对比学习的效率，即使在小批量下也能达到甚至超越现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) is a prevalent technique for training embedding
models, which pulls semantically similar examples (positives) closer in the
representation space while pushing dissimilar ones (negatives) further apart. A
key source of negatives are 'in-batch' examples, i.e., positives from other
examples in the batch. Effectiveness of such models is hence strongly
influenced by the size and quality of training batches. In this work, we
propose 'Breaking the Batch Barrier' (B3), a novel batch construction strategy
designed to curate high-quality batches for CL. Our approach begins by using a
pretrained teacher embedding model to rank all examples in the dataset, from
which a sparse similarity graph is constructed. A community detection algorithm
is then applied to this graph to identify clusters of examples that serve as
strong negatives for one another. The clusters are then used to construct
batches that are rich in in-batch negatives. Empirical results on the MMEB
multimodal embedding benchmark (36 tasks) demonstrate that our method sets a
new state of the art, outperforming previous best methods by +1.3 and +2.9
points at the 7B and 2B model scales, respectively. Notably, models trained
with B3 surpass existing state-of-the-art results even with a batch size as
small as 64, which is 4-16x smaller than that required by other methods.

Abstract: The assessment of evaluation metrics (meta-evaluation) is crucial for
determining the suitability of existing metrics in text-to-image (T2I)
generation tasks. Human-based meta-evaluation is costly and time-intensive, and
automated alternatives are scarce. We address this gap and propose CROC: a
scalable framework for automated Contrastive Robustness Checks that
systematically probes and quantifies metric robustness by synthesizing
contrastive test cases across a comprehensive taxonomy of image properties.
With CROC, we generate a pseudo-labeled dataset (CROC$^{syn}$) of over one
million contrastive prompt-image pairs to enable a fine-grained comparison of
evaluation metrics. We also use the dataset to train CROCScore, a new metric
that achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods,
demonstrating an additional key application of our framework. To complement
this dataset, we introduce a human-supervised benchmark (CROC$^{hum}$)
targeting especially challenging categories. Our results highlight robustness
issues in existing metrics: for example, many fail on prompts involving
negation, and all tested open-source metrics fail on at least 25% of cases
involving correct identification of body parts.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in offline tasks
such as image captioning and video question answering. However, real-time
interactive environments impose new demands on VLMs, requiring them to generate
utterances that are not only semantically accurate but also precisely timed. We
identify two core capabilities necessary for such settings --
$\textit{perceptual updating}$ and $\textit{contingency awareness}$ -- and
propose a new benchmark task, $\textbf{Temporally-Grounded Language Generation
(TGLG)}$, to evaluate them. TGLG requires models to generate utterances in
response to streaming video such that both content and timing align with
dynamic visual input. To support this benchmark, we curate evaluation datasets
from sports broadcasting and egocentric human interaction domains, and
introduce a new metric, $\textbf{TRACE}$, to evaluate TGLG by jointly measuring
semantic similarity and temporal alignment. Finally, we present
$\textbf{Vision-Language Model with Time-Synchronized Interleaving (VLM-TSI)}$,
a model that interleaves visual and linguistic tokens in a time-synchronized
manner, enabling real-time language generation without relying on turn-based
assumptions. Experimental results show that VLM-TSI significantly outperforms a

Abstract: This work aims at a challenging task: human action-reaction synthesis, i.e.,
generating human reactions based on the action sequence of the other as
conditions. Currently, autoregressive modeling approaches have achieved
remarkable performance in motion generation tasks, e.g. text-to-motion.
However, vector quantization (VQ) accompanying autoregressive generation has
inherent disadvantages, including loss of quantization information, low
codebook utilization, etc. Moreover, unlike text-to-motion, which focuses
solely on the movement of body joints, human action-reaction synthesis also
encompasses fine-grained hand movements. In this work, we propose MARRS, a
novel framework designed to generate coordinated and fine-grained reaction
motions in continuous representations. Initially, we present the
Unit-distinguished Motion Variational AutoEncoder (UD-VAE), which segments the
entire body into distinct body and hand units, encoding them independently.
Subsequently, we propose Action-Conditioned Fusion (ACF), which involves
randomly masking a subset of reactive tokens and extracting specific
information about the body and hands from the active tokens. Furthermore, we
introduce Adaptive Unit Modulation (AUM) to facilitate interaction between body
and hand units by using the information from one unit to adaptively modulate
the other. Finally, for the diffusion model, we employ a compact MLP as a noise
predictor for each distinct body unit and incorporate the diffusion loss to
model the probability distribution of each token. Quantitative and qualitative
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance. The code
will be released upon acceptance.

### [133] [Dynamic Base model Shift for Delta Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11344)
*Chenyu Huang,Peng Ye,Shenghe Zheng,Xiaohui Wang,Lei Bai,Tao Chen,Wanli Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出动态基础模型偏移（DBMS）方法，通过动态调整基础模型和压缩规模，显著提升高压缩率下的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在极高压缩率下性能下降严重，且预训练基础模型通常非最优。

Method: 动态调整基础模型和压缩规模参数，优化压缩性能。

Result: DBMS在极高压缩率下仍能保持微调模型性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DBMS方法高效且通用，适用于多种模型和任务。

Abstract: Transformer-based models with the pretrain-finetune paradigm bring about
significant progress, along with the heavy storage and deployment costs of
finetuned models on multiple tasks. Delta compression attempts to lower the
costs by reducing the redundancy of delta parameters (i.e., the difference
between the finetuned and pre-trained model weights) through pruning or
quantization. However, existing methods by default employ the pretrained model
as the base model and compress the delta parameters for every task, which may
causes significant performance degradation, especially when the compression
rate is extremely high. To tackle this issue, we investigate the impact of
different base models on the performance of delta compression and find that the
pre-trained base model can hardly be optimal. To this end, we propose Dynamic
Base Model Shift (DBMS), which dynamically adapts the base model to the target
task before performing delta compression. Specifically, we adjust two
parameters, which respectively determine the magnitude of the base model shift
and the overall scale of delta compression, to boost the compression
performance on each task. Through low-cost learning of these two parameters,
our DBMS can maintain most of the finetuned model's performance even under an
extremely high compression ratio setting, significantly surpassing existing
methods. Moreover, our DBMS is orthogonal and can be integrated with a variety
of other methods, and it has been evaluated across different types of models
including language, vision transformer, and multi-modal models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dynam3D提出了一种动态分层3D表示模型，用于解决视频语言大模型在3D导航任务中的几何理解、大规模探索和动态环境适应问题，并在多个VLN基准测试中取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频语言大模型在3D导航任务中存在对几何和空间语义理解不足、大规模探索能力有限以及对动态环境适应性差的问题。

Method: 通过将2D CLIP特征投影到3D空间，构建多层次的3D表示（patch-instance-zone），并采用动态分层更新策略，实现3D几何和语义理解。

Result: Dynam3D在R2R-CE、REVERIE-CE和NavRAG-CE等VLN基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，并通过实验验证了其在实际部署中的有效性。

Conclusion: Dynam3D通过动态分层3D表示和语言对齐训练，显著提升了3D导航任务的性能，为实际应用提供了可行性。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a core task where embodied agents
leverage their spatial mobility to navigate in 3D environments toward
designated destinations based on natural language instructions. Recently,
video-language large models (Video-VLMs) with strong generalization
capabilities and rich commonsense knowledge have shown remarkable performance
when applied to VLN tasks. However, these models still encounter the following
challenges when applied to real-world 3D navigation: 1) Insufficient
understanding of 3D geometry and spatial semantics; 2) Limited capacity for
large-scale exploration and long-term environmental memory; 3) Poor
adaptability to dynamic and changing environments.To address these limitations,
we propose Dynam3D, a dynamic layered 3D representation model that leverages
language-aligned, generalizable, and hierarchical 3D representations as visual
input to train 3D-VLM in navigation action prediction. Given posed RGB-D
images, our Dynam3D projects 2D CLIP features into 3D space and constructs
multi-level 3D patch-instance-zone representations for 3D geometric and
semantic understanding with a dynamic and layer-wise update strategy. Our
Dynam3D is capable of online encoding and localization of 3D instances, and
dynamically updates them in changing environments to provide large-scale
exploration and long-term memory capabilities for navigation. By leveraging
large-scale 3D-language pretraining and task-specific adaptation, our Dynam3D
sets new state-of-the-art performance on VLN benchmarks including R2R-CE,
REVERIE-CE and NavRAG-CE under monocular settings. Furthermore, experiments for
pre-exploration, lifelong memory, and real-world robot validate the
effectiveness of practical deployment.

Motivation: NeRF在3D场景合成中表现出色，但数据有限时性能下降，现有方法缺乏统一的理论支持。

Method: 引入互信息作为统一度量，优化视角选择和合成，采用贪心算法和正则化项。

Result: 实验表明，MutualNeRF在有限样本下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MutualNeRF通过互信息理论有效提升了NeRF在有限数据下的性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces MutualNeRF, a framework enhancing Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF) performance under limited samples using Mutual Information Theory. While
NeRF excels in 3D scene synthesis, challenges arise with limited data and
existing methods that aim to introduce prior knowledge lack theoretical support
in a unified framework. We introduce a simple but theoretically robust concept,
Mutual Information, as a metric to uniformly measure the correlation between
images, considering both macro (semantic) and micro (pixel) levels.
  For sparse view sampling, we strategically select additional viewpoints
containing more non-overlapping scene information by minimizing mutual
information without knowing ground truth images beforehand. Our framework
employs a greedy algorithm, offering a near-optimal solution.
  For few-shot view synthesis, we maximize the mutual information between
inferred images and ground truth, expecting inferred images to gain more
relevant information from known images. This is achieved by incorporating
efficient, plug-and-play regularization terms.
  Experiments under limited samples show consistent improvement over
state-of-the-art baselines in different settings, affirming the efficacy of our
framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前病理学视觉语言模型在诊断准确性和推理合理性上存在不足，主要由于数据集缺乏深度和结构化诊断范式。

Method: 利用病理学教科书和专家构建高质量数据集，采用三阶段训练：知识注入、推理激励和强化学习优化。

Result: Patho-R1和PathoCLIP在多项病理学任务中表现优异，包括零样本分类和跨模态检索。

Conclusion: Patho-R1通过高质量数据集和强化学习显著提升了病理学推理能力，为病理学领域提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) have enabled broad progress
in the general medical field. However, pathology still remains a more
challenging subdomain, with current pathology specific VLMs exhibiting
limitations in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning plausibility. Such
shortcomings are largely attributable to the nature of current pathology
datasets, which are primarily composed of image description pairs that lack the
depth and structured diagnostic paradigms employed by real world pathologists.
In this study, we leverage pathology textbooks and real world pathology experts
to construct high-quality, reasoning-oriented datasets. Building on this, we
introduce Patho-R1, a multimodal RL-based pathology Reasoner, trained through a
three-stage pipeline: (1) continued pretraining on 3.5 million image-text pairs
for knowledge infusion; (2) supervised fine-tuning on 500k high-quality
Chain-of-Thought samples for reasoning incentivizing; (3) reinforcement
learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization and Decoupled Clip and
Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization strategies for multimodal reasoning
quality refinement. To further assess the alignment quality of our dataset, we
propose PathoCLIP, trained on the same figure-caption corpus used for continued
pretraining. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that both PathoCLIP
and Patho-R1 achieve robust performance across a wide range of
pathology-related tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal
retrieval, Visual Question Answering, and Multiple Choice Question. Our project

Method: 基于情感心理学知识和真实世界多模态感知，采用对抗性二元问答框架评估38个LLMs和MLLMs。

Result: 发现当前模型普遍存在情感幻觉问题，闭源模型表现优于开源模型，推理能力提供额外优势。

Conclusion: 研究启发提出PEP-MEK框架，平均提升9.90%的情感幻觉检测性能。

Abstract: Emotion understanding is a critical yet challenging task. Recent advances in
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced their
capabilities in this area. However, MLLMs often suffer from hallucinations,
generating irrelevant or nonsensical content. To the best of our knowledge,
despite the importance of this issue, there has been no dedicated effort to
evaluate emotion-related hallucinations in MLLMs. In this work, we introduce
EmotionHallucer, the first benchmark for detecting and analyzing emotion
hallucinations in MLLMs. Unlike humans, whose emotion understanding stems from
the interplay of biology and social learning, MLLMs rely solely on data-driven
learning and lack innate emotional instincts. Fortunately, emotion psychology
provides a solid foundation of knowledge about human emotions. Building on
this, we assess emotion hallucinations from two dimensions: emotion psychology
knowledge and real-world multimodal perception. To support robust evaluation,
we utilize an adversarial binary question-answer (QA) framework, which employs
carefully crafted basic and hallucinated pairs to assess the emotion
hallucination tendencies of MLLMs. By evaluating 38 LLMs and MLLMs on
EmotionHallucer, we reveal that: i) most current models exhibit substantial
issues with emotion hallucinations; ii) closed-source models outperform
open-source ones in detecting emotion hallucinations, and reasoning capability
provides additional advantages; iii) existing models perform better in emotion
psychology knowledge than in multimodal emotion perception. As a byproduct,
these findings inspire us to propose the PEP-MEK framework, which yields an
average improvement of 9.90% in emotion hallucination detection across selected
models. Resources will be available at

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法提升了零样本姿态估计的泛化能力，并首次将RGB-D零样本方法应用于RMIS。

Abstract: Accurate pose estimation of surgical tools in Robot-assisted Minimally
Invasive Surgery (RMIS) is essential for surgical navigation and robot control.
While traditional marker-based methods offer accuracy, they face challenges
with occlusions, reflections, and tool-specific designs. Similarly, supervised
learning methods require extensive training on annotated datasets, limiting
their adaptability to new tools. Despite their success in other domains,
zero-shot pose estimation models remain unexplored in RMIS for pose estimation
of surgical instruments, creating a gap in generalising to unseen surgical
tools. This paper presents a novel 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) pose estimation
pipeline for surgical instruments, leveraging state-of-the-art zero-shot RGB-D
models like the FoundationPose and SAM-6D. We advanced these models by
incorporating vision-based depth estimation using the RAFT-Stereo method, for
robust depth estimation in reflective and textureless environments.
Additionally, we enhanced SAM-6D by replacing its instance segmentation module,
Segment Anything Model (SAM), with a fine-tuned Mask R-CNN, significantly
boosting segmentation accuracy in occluded and complex conditions. Extensive
validation reveals that our enhanced SAM-6D surpasses FoundationPose in
zero-shot pose estimation of unseen surgical instruments, setting a new
benchmark for zero-shot RGB-D pose estimation in RMIS. This work enhances the
generalisability of pose estimation for unseen objects and pioneers the
application of RGB-D zero-shot methods in RMIS.

Result: 模型能同时生成高质量、完整的各层图像，并确保层间的空间和视觉交互以实现全局一致性。

Conclusion: PSDiffusion为多层图像生成提供了一种高效且一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have made remarkable advancements in generating high-quality
images from textual descriptions. Recent works like LayerDiffuse have extended
the previous single-layer, unified image generation paradigm to transparent
image layer generation. However, existing multi-layer generation methods fail
to handle the interactions among multiple layers such as rational global
layout, physics-plausible contacts and visual effects like shadows and
reflections while maintaining high alpha quality. To solve this problem, we
propose PSDiffusion, a unified diffusion framework for simultaneous multi-layer
text-to-image generation. Our model can automatically generate multi-layer
images with one RGB background and multiple RGBA foregrounds through a single
feed-forward process. Unlike existing methods that combine multiple tools for
post-decomposition or generate layers sequentially and separately, our method
introduces a global-layer interactive mechanism that generates layered-images
concurrently and collaboratively, ensuring not only high quality and
completeness for each layer, but also spatial and visual interactions among
layers for global coherence.

Conclusion: 该方法仅需损坏测量即可估计分布偏移并改善重建效果，适用于多种逆问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used as priors in imaging inverse problems.
However, their performance often degrades under distribution shifts between the
training and test-time images. Existing methods for identifying and quantifying
distribution shifts typically require access to clean test images, which are
almost never available while solving inverse problems (at test time). We
propose a fully unsupervised metric for estimating distribution shifts using
only indirect (corrupted) measurements and score functions from diffusion
models trained on different datasets. We theoretically show that this metric
estimates the KL divergence between the training and test image distributions.
Empirically, we show that our score-based metric, using only corrupted
measurements, closely approximates the KL divergence computed from clean
images. Motivated by this result, we show that aligning the out-of-distribution
score with the in-distribution score -- using only corrupted measurements --
reduces the KL divergence and leads to improved reconstruction quality across
multiple inverse problems.

Conclusion: GIE-Bench为文本引导图像编辑的评估提供了可扩展、可复现的框架。

Abstract: Editing images using natural language instructions has become a natural and
expressive way to modify visual content; yet, evaluating the performance of
such models remains challenging. Existing evaluation approaches often rely on
image-text similarity metrics like CLIP, which lack precision. In this work, we
introduce a new benchmark designed to evaluate text-guided image editing models
in a more grounded manner, along two critical dimensions: (i) functional
correctness, assessed via automatically generated multiple-choice questions
that verify whether the intended change was successfully applied; and (ii)
image content preservation, which ensures that non-targeted regions of the
image remain visually consistent using an object-aware masking technique and
preservation scoring. The benchmark includes over 1000 high-quality editing
examples across 20 diverse content categories, each annotated with detailed
editing instructions, evaluation questions, and spatial object masks. We
conduct a large-scale study comparing GPT-Image-1, the latest flagship in the
text-guided image editing space, against several state-of-the-art editing
models, and validate our automatic metrics against human ratings. Results show
that GPT-Image-1 leads in instruction-following accuracy, but often
over-modifies irrelevant image regions, highlighting a key trade-off in the
current model behavior. GIE-Bench provides a scalable, reproducible framework
for advancing more accurate evaluation of text-guided image editing.

Motivation: 视频扩散模型的计算和内存需求高，现有量化方法直接应用于视频DMs效果不佳，需要一种新的解决方案。

Method: 提出QVGen框架，通过引入辅助模块（Φ）减少量化误差，并采用秩衰减策略逐步消除Φ，以保持性能并消除推理开销。

Result: QVGen在4位量化下首次达到与全精度相当的质量，并在多个SOTA视频DMs上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: QVGen为视频DMs的高效量化提供了一种有效解决方案，显著提升了性能并减少了计算成本。

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis. Yet,
their substantial computational and memory demands pose serious challenges to
real-world deployment, even on high-end GPUs. As a commonly adopted solution,
quantization has proven notable success in reducing cost for image DMs, while
its direct application to video DMs remains ineffective. In this paper, we
present QVGen, a novel quantization-aware training (QAT) framework tailored for
high-performance and inference-efficient video DMs under extremely low-bit
quantization (e.g., 4-bit or below). We begin with a theoretical analysis
demonstrating that reducing the gradient norm is essential to facilitate
convergence for QAT. To this end, we introduce auxiliary modules ($\Phi$) to
mitigate large quantization errors, leading to significantly enhanced
convergence. To eliminate the inference overhead of $\Phi$, we propose a
rank-decay strategy that progressively eliminates $\Phi$. Specifically, we
repeatedly employ singular value decomposition (SVD) and a proposed rank-based
regularization $\mathbf{\gamma}$ to identify and decay low-contributing
components. This strategy retains performance while zeroing out inference
overhead. Extensive experiments across $4$ state-of-the-art (SOTA) video DMs,
with parameter sizes ranging from $1.3$B $\sim14$B, show that QVGen is the
first to reach full-precision comparable quality under 4-bit settings.
Moreover, it significantly outperforms existing methods. For instance, our
3-bit CogVideoX-2B achieves improvements of $+25.28$ in Dynamic Degree and
$+8.43$ in Scene Consistency on VBench.

Abstract: We discuss the challenges and propose a framework for evaluating engineering
artificial general intelligence (eAGI) agents. We consider eAGI as a
specialization of artificial general intelligence (AGI), deemed capable of
addressing a broad range of problems in the engineering of physical systems and
associated controllers. We exclude software engineering for a tractable scoping
of eAGI and expect dedicated software engineering AI agents to address the
software implementation challenges. Similar to human engineers, eAGI agents
should possess a unique blend of background knowledge (recall and retrieve) of
facts and methods, demonstrate familiarity with tools and processes, exhibit
deep understanding of industrial components and well-known design families, and
be able to engage in creative problem solving (analyze and synthesize),
transferring ideas acquired in one context to another. Given this broad
mandate, evaluating and qualifying the performance of eAGI agents is a
challenge in itself and, arguably, a critical enabler to developing eAGI
agents. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing an extensible
evaluation framework that specializes and grounds Bloom's taxonomy - a
framework for evaluating human learning that has also been recently used for
evaluating LLMs - in an engineering design context. Our proposed framework
advances the state of the art in benchmarking and evaluation of AI agents in
terms of the following: (a) developing a rich taxonomy of evaluation questions
spanning from methodological knowledge to real-world design problems; (b)
motivating a pluggable evaluation framework that can evaluate not only textual
responses but also evaluate structured design artifacts such as CAD models and
SysML models; and (c) outlining an automatable procedure to customize the
evaluation benchmark to different engineering contexts.

Motivation: LLM代理的不可预测性引发了安全担忧，研究旨在探索其在博弈论环境中的行为，并提出提高可靠性的方法。

Method: 引入了一种策略修改方法，通过稀疏自编码器提取的特征引导代理的残差流，独立于游戏和提示。

Result: 使用善意谈判特征引导后，平均背叛概率降低了28个百分点，并确定了多个开源LLM代理的可行引导范围。

Conclusion: 博弈论评估与表示引导对齐方法可推广到现实应用，适用于终端设备和嵌入式平台。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) enable novel use
cases in domains where responsible action is increasingly important. Yet the
inherent unpredictability of LLMs raises safety concerns about agent
reliability. In this work, we explore agent behaviour in a toy, game-theoretic
environment based on a variation of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. We
introduce a strategy-modification method-independent of both the game and the
prompt-by steering the residual stream with interpretable features extracted
from a sparse autoencoder latent space. Steering with the good-faith
negotiation feature lowers the average defection probability by 28 percentage
points. We also identify feasible steering ranges for several open-source LLM
agents. Finally, we hypothesise that game-theoretic evaluation of LLM agents,
combined with representation-steering alignment, can generalise to real-world
applications on end-user devices and embodied platforms.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) is gaining momentum in the
machine learning communities with the goal of leveraging current progress in AI
(deep learning, transformers, large language and visual-language models) to
empower robots. In this chapter we put this work in the context of "Good
Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence" (GOFAI) (Haugeland, 1989) and the
behavior-based or embodied alternatives (R. A. Brooks 1991; Pfeifer and Scheier
2001). We claim that the AI-powered robots are only weakly embodied and inherit
some of the problems of GOFAI. Moreover, we review and critically discuss the
possibility of cross-embodiment learning (Padalkar et al. 2024). We identify
fundamental roadblocks and propose directions on how to make progress.

Conclusion: 提出更全面的人机协作评估方法，为优化AI增强工作流程提供见解。

Abstract: Current AI benchmarks miss the messy, multi-turn nature of human-AI
collaboration. We present an evaluation framework that decomposes real-world
tasks into interdependent subtasks, letting us track both LLM performance and
users' strategies across a dialogue. Complementing this framework, we develop a
suite of metrics, including a composite usage derived from semantic similarity,
word overlap, and numerical matches; structural coherence; intra-turn
diversity; and a novel measure of the "information frontier" reflecting the
alignment between AI outputs and users' working knowledge. We demonstrate our
methodology in a financial valuation task that mirrors real-world complexity.
Our empirical findings reveal that while greater integration of LLM-generated
content generally enhances output quality, its benefits are moderated by
factors such as response incoherence, excessive subtask diversity, and the
distance of provided information from users' existing knowledge. These results
suggest that proactive dialogue strategies designed to inject novelty may
inadvertently undermine task performance. Our work thus advances a more
holistic evaluation of human-AI collaboration, offering both a robust
methodological framework and actionable insights for developing more effective
AI-augmented work processes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的迭代程序化规划（IPP）框架，通过生成可解释的代码策略解决网格任务，显著优于直接代码生成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统搜索或强化学习方法在网格任务中效率较低，而直接使用LLM生成代码策略可以更高效且可解释地解决问题。

Method: 采用代码生成作为策略合成，结合多种提示策略（直接代码生成、伪代码条件细化、课程提示）和迭代细化机制，根据任务反馈更新代码。

Result: 在六个主流LLM和两个网格基准测试（GRASP和MiniGrid）中，IPP框架比直接代码生成性能提升10%至10倍，并在GRASP上达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: IPP框架通过代码生成和迭代优化，显著提升了网格任务的解决效率，同时降低了长期计算成本。

Abstract: We propose an iterative programmatic planning (IPP) framework for solving
grid-based tasks by synthesizing interpretable agent policies expressed in code
using large language models (LLMs). Instead of relying on traditional search or
reinforcement learning, our approach uses code generation as policy synthesis,
where the LLM outputs executable programs that map environment states to action
sequences. Our proposed architecture incorporates several prompting strategies,
including direct code generation, pseudocode-conditioned refinement, and
curriculum-based prompting, but also includes an iterative refinement mechanism
that updates code based on task performance feedback. We evaluate our approach
using six leading LLMs and two challenging grid-based benchmarks (GRASP and
MiniGrid). Our IPP framework demonstrates improvements over direct code
generation ranging from 10\% to as much as 10x across five of the six models
and establishes a new state-of-the-art result for GRASP. IPP is found to
significantly outperform direct elicitation of a solution from GPT-o3-mini (by
63\% on MiniGrid to 116\% on GRASP), demonstrating the viability of the overall
approach. Computational costs of all code generation approaches are similar.
While code generation has a higher initial prompting cost compared to direct
solution elicitation (\$0.08 per task vs. \$0.002 per instance for
GPT-o3-mini), the code can be reused for any number of instances, making the
amortized cost significantly lower (by 400x on GPT-o3-mini across the complete
GRASP benchmark).

Conclusion: 该方法在临床试验设计和匹配任务中具有显著优势，能有效优化协议设计和提高效率。

Abstract: Clinical trials are vital for evaluation of safety and efficacy of new
treatments. However, clinical trials are resource-intensive, time-consuming and
expensive to conduct, where errors in trial design, reduced efficacy, and
safety events can result in significant delays, financial losses, and damage to
reputation. These risks underline the importance of informed and strategic
decisions in trial design to mitigate these risks and improve the chances of a
successful trial. Identifying similar historical trials is critical as these
trials can provide an important reference for potential pitfalls and challenges
including serious adverse events, dosage inaccuracies, recruitment
difficulties, patient adherence issues, etc. Addressing these challenges in
trial design can lead to development of more effective study protocols with
optimized patient safety and trial efficiency. In this paper, we present a
novel method to identify similar historical trials by summarizing clinical
trial protocols and searching for similar trials based on a query trial's
protocol. Our approach significantly outperforms all baselines, achieving up to
a 78% improvement in recall@1 and a 53% improvement in precision@1 over the
best baseline. We also show that our method outperforms all other baselines in
partial trial similarity search and zero-shot patient-trial matching,
highlighting its superior utility in these tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在农业中的应用存在算法建议与农民实际经验之间的脱节，限制了AI的广泛采用。

Method: 采用人类-AI交互（HAII）框架，结合信任模型（能力、善意、诚信）和多目标强化学习，优化施肥策略。

Result: 研究发现农民对AI的信任存在关键偏差，并将其整合到RL框架中，确保建议的技术稳健性和社会可接受性。

Conclusion: 通过技术性能与人类信任的结合，该研究促进了AI在农业中的更广泛应用。

Abstract: Precision agriculture, enhanced by artificial intelligence (AI), offers
promising tools such as remote sensing, intelligent irrigation, fertilization
management, and crop simulation to improve agricultural efficiency and
sustainability. Reinforcement learning (RL), in particular, has outperformed
traditional methods in optimizing yields and resource management. However,
widespread AI adoption is limited by gaps between algorithmic recommendations
and farmers' practical experience, local knowledge, and traditional practices.
To address this, our study emphasizes Human-AI Interaction (HAII), focusing on
transparency, usability, and trust in RL-based farm management. We employ a
well-established trust framework - comprising ability, benevolence, and
integrity - to develop a novel mathematical model quantifying farmers'
confidence in AI-based fertilization strategies. Surveys conducted with farmers
for this research reveal critical misalignments, which are integrated into our
trust model and incorporated into a multi-objective RL framework. Unlike prior
methods, our approach embeds trust directly into policy optimization, ensuring
AI recommendations are technically robust, economically feasible,
context-aware, and socially acceptable. By aligning technical performance with
human-centered trust, this research supports broader AI adoption in
agriculture.

Method: 提出PoE-World方法，将世界模型表示为LLM合成的程序化专家的指数加权乘积，适用于复杂非网格世界领域。

Result: 该方法能从少量观察中学习复杂随机世界模型，并在Pong和Montezuma's Revenge游戏中展示了高效性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PoE-World为复杂领域的世界建模提供了一种高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning how the world works is central to building AI agents that can adapt
to complex environments. Traditional world models based on deep learning demand
vast amounts of training data, and do not flexibly update their knowledge from
sparse observations. Recent advances in program synthesis using Large Language
Models (LLMs) give an alternate approach which learns world models represented
as source code, supporting strong generalization from little data. To date,
application of program-structured world models remains limited to natural
language and grid-world domains. We introduce a novel program synthesis method
for effectively modeling complex, non-gridworld domains by representing a world
model as an exponentially-weighted product of programmatic experts (PoE-World)
synthesized by LLMs. We show that this approach can learn complex, stochastic
world models from just a few observations. We evaluate the learned world models
by embedding them in a model-based planning agent, demonstrating efficient
performance and generalization to unseen levels on Atari's Pong and Montezuma's
Revenge. We release our code and display the learned world models and videos of
the agent's gameplay at https://topwasu.github.io/poe-world.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence have introduced
groundbreaking approaches to innovating next-generation semantic communication,
which prioritizes conveying the meaning of a message rather than merely
transmitting raw data. A fundamental challenge in semantic communication lies
in accurately identifying and extracting the most critical semantic information
while adapting to downstream tasks without degrading performance, particularly
when the objective at the receiver may evolve over time. To enable flexible
adaptation to multiple tasks at the receiver, this work introduces a novel
semantic communication framework, which is capable of jointly capturing
task-specific information to enhance downstream task performance and contextual
information. Through rigorous experiments on popular image datasets and
computer vision tasks, our framework shows promising improvement compared to
existing work, including superior performance in downstream tasks, better
generalizability, ultra-high bandwidth efficiency, and low reconstruction
latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统准确性指标无法揭示模型如何得出解决方案，因此需要更深入的方法来评估模型的推理能力。

Method: 通过多层次的推理任务（如语义解析、生成解决方案、自我纠正、分步草图和利用提示）来评估LLMs的推理策略。

Result: LLMs在某些情况下能提出创造性的解决方案，但也存在依赖暴力求解的情况。

Conclusion: LLMs具备一定的创造性问题解决能力，但在推理效率上仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Accuracy remains a standard metric for evaluating AI systems, but it offers
limited insight into how models arrive at their solutions. In this work, we
introduce a benchmark based on brainteasers written in long narrative form to
probe more deeply into the types of reasoning strategies that models use.
Brainteasers are well-suited for this goal because they can be solved with
multiple approaches, such as a few-step solution that uses a creative insight
or a longer solution that uses more brute force. We investigate large language
models (LLMs) across multiple layers of reasoning, focusing not only on
correctness but also on the quality and creativity of their solutions. We
investigate many aspects of the reasoning process: (1) semantic parsing of the
brainteasers into precise mathematical competition style formats; (2)
generating solutions from these mathematical forms; (3) self-correcting
solutions based on gold solutions; (4) producing step-by-step sketches of
solutions; and (5) making use of hints. We find that LLMs are in many cases
able to find creative, insightful solutions to brainteasers, suggesting that
they capture some of the capacities needed to solve novel problems in creative
ways. Nonetheless, there also remain situations where they rely on brute force
despite the availability of more efficient, creative solutions, highlighting a
potential direction for improvement in the reasoning abilities of LLMs.

Conclusion: MCU是一个即插即用框架，可无缝集成现有方法，持续提升遗忘效果。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to remove the information of specific training
data from a trained model, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and
user requests. While one line of existing MU methods relies on linear parameter
updates via task arithmetic, they suffer from weight entanglement. In this
work, we propose a novel MU framework called Mode Connectivity Unlearning (MCU)
that leverages mode connectivity to find an unlearning pathway in a nonlinear
manner. To further enhance performance and efficiency, we introduce a parameter
mask strategy that not only improves unlearning effectiveness but also reduces
computational overhead. Moreover, we propose an adaptive adjustment strategy
for our unlearning penalty coefficient to adaptively balance forgetting quality
and predictive performance during training, eliminating the need for empirical
hyperparameter tuning. Unlike traditional MU methods that identify only a
single unlearning model, MCU uncovers a spectrum of unlearning models along the
pathway. Overall, MCU serves as a plug-and-play framework that seamlessly
integrates with any existing MU methods, consistently improving unlearning
efficacy. Extensive experiments on the image classification task demonstrate
that MCU achieves superior performance.

Abstract: Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) in formal languages remains a formidable
challenge in AI, demanding rigorous logical deduction and navigating vast
search spaces. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promising
performance, existing stepwise provers often suffer from biased search
guidance, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal proof strategies. This paper
introduces the Multi-Perspective Search Prover (MPS-Prover), a novel stepwise
ATP system designed to overcome these limitations. MPS-Prover incorporates two
key innovations: a highly effective post-training data curation strategy that
prunes approximately 40% of redundant training data without sacrificing
performance, and a multi-perspective tree search mechanism. This search
integrates a learned critic model with strategically designed heuristic rules
to diversify tactic selection, prevent getting trapped in unproductive states,
and enhance search robustness. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that
MPS-Prover achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging
benchmarks, including miniF2F and ProofNet, outperforming prior 7B parameter
models. Furthermore, our analyses reveal that MPS-Prover generates
significantly shorter and more diverse proofs compared to existing stepwise and
whole-proof methods, highlighting its efficiency and efficacy. Our work
advances the capabilities of LLM-based formal reasoning and offers a robust
framework and a comprehensive analysis for developing more powerful theorem
provers.

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索不同推理提示策略在测试时计算扩展下的表现，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过系统实验（6种LLM × 8种提示策略 × 6个基准测试）和理论分析，比较不同提示策略的扩展性能，并提出预测方法和改进策略。

Result: 实验结果显示，随着采样时间和计算开销增加，复杂的提示策略性能逐渐落后于简单的思维链。理论分析和预测方法验证了这一现象。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁重新审视复杂提示策略的作用，释放简单策略的潜力，并为提升测试时扩展性能提供新思路。

Abstract: Recently, scaling test-time compute on Large Language Models (LLM) has
garnered wide attention. However, there has been limited investigation of how
various reasoning prompting strategies perform as scaling. In this paper, we
focus on a standard and realistic scaling setting: majority voting. We
systematically conduct experiments on 6 LLMs $\times$ 8 prompting strategies
$\times$ 6 benchmarks. Experiment results consistently show that as the
sampling time and computational overhead increase, complicated prompting
strategies with superior initial performance gradually fall behind simple
Chain-of-Thought. We analyze this phenomenon and provide theoretical proofs.
Additionally, we propose a method according to probability theory to quickly
and accurately predict the scaling performance and select the best strategy
under large sampling times without extra resource-intensive inference in
practice. It can serve as the test-time scaling law for majority voting.
Furthermore, we introduce two ways derived from our theoretical analysis to
significantly improve the scaling performance. We hope that our research can
promote to re-examine the role of complicated prompting, unleash the potential
of simple prompting strategies, and provide new insights for enhancing
test-time scaling performance.

Conclusion: facets为论证推理提供了一种自然且高效的方法，适用于用户导航和过滤特定论证的需求。

Abstract: Argumentation is a central subarea of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for
modeling and reasoning about arguments. The semantics of abstract argumentation
frameworks (AFs) is given by sets of arguments (extensions) and conditions on
the relationship between them, such as stable or admissible. Today's solvers
implement tasks such as finding extensions, deciding credulous or skeptical
acceptance, counting, or enumerating extensions. While these tasks are well
charted, the area between decision, counting/enumeration and fine-grained
reasoning requires expensive reasoning so far. We introduce a novel concept
(facets) for reasoning between decision and enumeration. Facets are arguments
that belong to some extensions (credulous) but not to all extensions
(skeptical). They are most natural when a user aims to navigate, filter, or
comprehend the significance of specific arguments, according to their needs. We
study the complexity and show that tasks involving facets are much easier than
counting extensions. Finally, we provide an implementation, and conduct
experiments to demonstrate feasibility.

Abstract: Plastic injection molding remains essential to modern manufacturing. However,
optimizing process parameters to balance product quality and profitability
under dynamic environmental and economic conditions remains a persistent
challenge. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
framework for real-time process optimization in injection molding, integrating
product quality and profitability into the control objective. A profit function
was developed to reflect real-world manufacturing costs, incorporating resin,
mold wear, and electricity prices, including time-of-use variations. Surrogate
models were constructed to predict product quality and cycle time, enabling
efficient offline training of DRL agents using soft actor-critic (SAC) and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed DRL framework can dynamically adapt to seasonal and
operational variations, consistently maintaining product quality while
maximizing profit. Compared to traditional optimization methods such as genetic
algorithms, the DRL models achieved comparable economic performance with up to
135x faster inference speeds, making them well-suited for real-time
applications. The framework's scalability and adaptability highlight its
potential as a foundation for intelligent, data-driven decision-making in
modern manufacturing environments.

TL;DR: RAGSynth框架通过合成数据优化检索器和生成器性能，显著提升RAG系统表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索器依赖公共知识且难以处理复杂查询，生成器存在保真度问题，需改进。

Method: 提出RAGSynth框架，包括数据建模和合成数据生成，并引入SynthBench基准测试。

Result: 合成数据显著提升检索器鲁棒性和生成器保真度，且能跨领域泛化。

Conclusion: RAGSynth有效优化RAG系统性能，已开源实现。

Abstract: RAG can enhance the performance of LLMs on knowledge-intensive tasks. Various
RAG paradigms, including vanilla, planning-based, and iterative RAG, are built
upon 2 cores: the retriever, which should robustly select relevant documents
across complex queries, and the generator, which should faithfully synthesize
responses. However, existing retrievers rely heavily on public knowledge and
struggle with queries of varying logical complexity and clue completeness,
while generators frequently face fidelity problems. In this work, we introduce
RAGSynth, a framework that includes a data construction modeling and a
corresponding synthetic data generation implementation, designed to optimize
retriever robustness and generator fidelity. Additionally, we present
SynthBench, a benchmark encompassing 8 domain-specific documents across 4
domains, featuring diverse query complexities, clue completeness, and
fine-grained citation granularity. Leveraging RAGSynth, we generate a
large-scale synthetic dataset, including single and multi-hop. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the synthetic data significantly improves the
robustness of the retrievers and the fidelity of the generators. Additional
evaluations confirm that RAGSynth can also generalize well across different
domains. By integrating the optimized retrievers into various RAG paradigms, we
consistently observe enhanced RAG system performance. We have open-sourced the
implementation on https://github.com/EachSheep/RAGSynth.

Motivation: 可解释人工智能（XAI）对建立AI系统的信任至关重要，但现有溯因解释可能过于具体，无法适用于数值输入的广泛情况。

Result: 该方法能够生成覆盖范围最广且正确的解释，适用于多种输入情况。

Conclusion: 最通用的溯因解释具有更广泛的适用性，是AI决策解释的理想选择。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is critical for attaining trust in
the operation of AI systems. A key question of an AI system is ``why was this
decision made this way''. Formal approaches to XAI use a formal model of the AI
system to identify abductive explanations. While abductive explanations may be
applicable to a large number of inputs sharing the same concrete values, more
general explanations may be preferred for numeric inputs. So-called inflated
abductive explanations give intervals for each feature ensuring that any input
whose values fall withing these intervals is still guaranteed to make the same
prediction. Inflated explanations cover a larger portion of the input space,
and hence are deemed more general explanations. But there can be many
(inflated) abductive explanations for an instance. Which is the best? In this
paper, we show how to find a most general abductive explanation for an AI
decision. This explanation covers as much of the input space as possible, while
still being a correct formal explanation of the model's behaviour. Given that
we only want to give a human one explanation for a decision, the most general
explanation gives us the explanation with the broadest applicability, and hence
the one most likely to seem sensible. (The paper has been accepted at IJCAI2025
conference.)

Result: 模型在实验中表现优异，平均F1分数超过第二名19.27%。

Conclusion: GuardReasoner-VL在提升VLM安全性方面具有显著优势，并开源了数据和模型。

Abstract: To enhance the safety of VLMs, this paper introduces a novel reasoning-based
VLM guard model dubbed GuardReasoner-VL. The core idea is to incentivize the
guard model to deliberatively reason before making moderation decisions via
online RL. First, we construct GuardReasoner-VLTrain, a reasoning corpus with
123K samples and 631K reasoning steps, spanning text, image, and text-image
inputs. Then, based on it, we cold-start our model's reasoning ability via SFT.
In addition, we further enhance reasoning regarding moderation through online
RL. Concretely, to enhance diversity and difficulty of samples, we conduct
rejection sampling followed by data augmentation via the proposed safety-aware
data concatenation. Besides, we use a dynamic clipping parameter to encourage
exploration in early stages and exploitation in later stages. To balance
performance and token efficiency, we design a length-aware safety reward that
integrates accuracy, format, and token cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our model. Remarkably, it surpasses the runner-up by 19.27%
F1 score on average. We release data, code, and models (3B/7B) of
GuardReasoner-VL at https://github.com/yueliu1999/GuardReasoner-VL/

TL;DR: 论文提出Thought-Aligner，一个动态修正LLM代理思考的插件模块，显著提升行为安全性至90%，同时保持低延迟和资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在复杂任务中的思考偏差可能导致安全风险，需动态修正以确保安全。

Method: 提出Thought-Aligner模块，通过轻量模型实时修正高风险思考，利用对比学习训练。

Result: 实验表明，安全性从50%提升至90%，延迟低于100ms，资源消耗低。

Conclusion: Thought-Aligner为LLM代理提供高效、广泛适用的动态安全解决方案。

Abstract: LLM-based autonomous agents possess capabilities such as reasoning, tool
invocation, and environment interaction, enabling the execution of complex
multi-step tasks. The internal reasoning process, i.e., thought, of behavioral
trajectory significantly influences tool usage and subsequent actions but can
introduce potential risks. Even minor deviations in the agent's thought may
trigger cascading effects leading to irreversible safety incidents. To address
the safety alignment challenges in long-horizon behavioral trajectories, we
propose Thought-Aligner, a plug-in dynamic thought correction module. Utilizing
a lightweight and resource-efficient model, Thought-Aligner corrects each
high-risk thought on the fly before each action execution. The corrected
thought is then reintroduced to the agent, ensuring safer subsequent decisions
and tool interactions. Importantly, Thought-Aligner modifies only the reasoning
phase without altering the underlying agent framework, making it easy to deploy
and widely applicable to various agent frameworks. To train the Thought-Aligner
model, we construct an instruction dataset across ten representative scenarios
and simulate ReAct execution trajectories, generating 5,000 diverse
instructions and more than 11,400 safe and unsafe thought pairs. The model is
fine-tuned using contrastive learning techniques. Experiments across three
agent safety benchmarks involving 12 different LLMs demonstrate that
Thought-Aligner raises agent behavioral safety from approximately 50% in the
unprotected setting to 90% on average. Additionally, Thought-Aligner maintains
response latency below 100ms with minimal resource usage, demonstrating its
capability for efficient deployment, broad applicability, and timely
responsiveness. This method thus provides a practical dynamic safety solution
for the LLM-based agents.

Motivation: 现有自动驾驶车辆的传感器（如摄像头和激光雷达）易受光照和天气变化影响，难以实时感知道路状况，亟需一种鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 设计了光照感知子网络以估计光照特征，并构建多模态融合网络动态调整模态权重，同时通过预训练和光照损失优化训练过程。

Result: 实验表明，IMF在复杂光照条件下优于现有方法，多模态融合在道路感知中展现出全面优势。

Conclusion: IMF通过光照感知和多模态动态融合，显著提升了自动驾驶车辆在多变光照条件下的道路感知能力。

Abstract: Road terrains play a crucial role in ensuring the driving safety of
autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, existing sensors of AVs, including cameras
and Lidars, are susceptible to variations in lighting and weather conditions,
making it challenging to achieve real-time perception of road conditions. In
this paper, we propose an illumination-aware multi-modal fusion network (IMF),
which leverages both exteroceptive and proprioceptive perception and optimizes
the fusion process based on illumination features. We introduce an
illumination-perception sub-network to accurately estimate illumination
features. Moreover, we design a multi-modal fusion network which is able to
dynamically adjust weights of different modalities according to illumination
features. We enhance the optimization process by pre-training of the
illumination-perception sub-network and incorporating illumination loss as one
of the training constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the IMF
shows a superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. The
comparison results with single modality perception methods highlight the
comprehensive advantages of multi-modal fusion in accurately perceiving road
terrains under varying lighting conditions. Our dataset is available at:

Motivation: 全渠道平台的兴起引发了对客户旅程的关注，但定量研究和综合分析因数据序列性和复杂性而不足。

Method: 提出三步法：1) 定义序列距离并可视化代表性序列；2) 基于距离预测购买概率；3) 对无购买序列推荐反事实序列以提升购买概率。

Result: 实验表明，典型序列可被提取，且能识别对购买重要的序列部分。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于改进多种营销活动。

Abstract: Recently, the proliferation of omni-channel platforms has attracted interest
in customer journeys, particularly regarding their role in developing marketing
strategies. However, few efforts have been taken to quantitatively study or
comprehensively analyze them owing to the sequential nature of their data and
the complexity involved in analysis. In this study, we propose a novel approach
comprising three steps for analyzing customer journeys. First, the distance
between sequential data is defined and used to identify and visualize
representative sequences. Second, the likelihood of purchase is predicted based
on this distance. Third, if a sequence suggests no purchase, counterfactual
sequences are recommended to increase the probability of a purchase using a
proposed method, which extracts counterfactual explanations for sequential
data. A survey was conducted, and the data were analyzed; the results revealed
that typical sequences could be extracted, and the parts of those sequences
important for purchase could be detected. We believe that the proposed approach
can support improvements in various marketing activities.

TL;DR: 提出Group Think方法，使单个大语言模型（LLM）模拟多个并发推理代理，通过动态调整推理轨迹减少冗余并降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多代理协作推理方法因轮流交互导致延迟增加，需要一种更高效的并发推理方式。

Method: Group Think让单个LLM作为多个并发推理代理，通过共享生成进度实现动态调整，减少冗余推理。

Result: 实验表明Group Think能显著降低延迟并提升推理质量，适用于边缘计算场景。

Conclusion: Group Think为LLM提供了一种高效并发协作推理的新范式，未来可进一步优化生成质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the power
of reasoning through self-generated chains of thought. Multiple reasoning
agents can collaborate to raise joint reasoning quality above individual
outcomes. However, such agents typically interact in a turn-based manner,
trading increased latency for improved quality. In this paper, we propose Group
Think--a single LLM that acts as multiple concurrent reasoning agents, or
thinkers. With shared visibility into each other's partial generation progress,
Group Think introduces a new concurrent-reasoning paradigm in which multiple
reasoning trajectories adapt dynamically to one another at the token level. For
example, a reasoning thread may shift its generation mid-sentence upon
detecting that another thread is better positioned to continue. This
fine-grained, token-level collaboration enables Group Think to reduce redundant
reasoning and improve quality while achieving significantly lower latency.
Moreover, its concurrent nature allows for efficient utilization of idle
computational resources, making it especially suitable for edge inference,
where very small batch size often underutilizes local~GPUs. We give a simple
and generalizable modification that enables any existing LLM to perform Group
Think on a local GPU. We also present an evaluation strategy to benchmark
reasoning latency and empirically demonstrate latency improvements using
open-source LLMs that were not explicitly trained for Group Think. We hope this
work paves the way for future LLMs to exhibit more sophisticated and more
efficient collaborative behavior for higher quality generation.

Motivation: 在离线教育环境中，数据质量差、规模有限和高度异质性阻碍了高级机器学习模型的应用，同时教育理论缺乏可量化指标，限制了其在数据驱动建模中的使用。

Method: 通过数据分析和教育文献综述，识别学生行为的突变作为辍学风险的早期信号，提出DMSW模型整合学业和行为数据。

Result: DMSW模型比传统方法预测准确率提高15%，帮助教育者更早识别高风险学生并提供支持。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了辍学预测理论与实践的差距，为教育者提供了创新工具，提升学生保留率和学习成果。

Abstract: Timely prediction of students at high risk of dropout is critical for early
intervention and improving educational outcomes. However, in offline
educational settings, poor data quality, limited scale, and high heterogeneity
often hinder the application of advanced machine learning models. Furthermore,
while educational theories provide valuable insights into dropout phenomena,
the lack of quantifiable metrics for key indicators limits their use in
data-driven modeling. Through data analysis and a review of educational
literature, we identified abrupt changes in student behavior as key early
signals of dropout risk. To address this, we propose the Dual-Modal Multiscale
Sliding Window (DMSW) Model, which integrates academic performance and
behavioral data to dynamically capture behavior patterns using minimal data.
The DMSW model improves prediction accuracy by 15% compared to traditional
methods, enabling educators to identify high-risk students earlier, provide
timely support, and foster a more inclusive learning environment. Our analysis
highlights key behavior patterns, offering practical insights for preventive
strategies and tailored support. These findings bridge the gap between theory
and practice in dropout prediction, giving educators an innovative tool to
enhance student retention and outcomes.

Result: 在真实股票市场数据上，该方法挖掘的Alpha因子在预测准确性、交易性能和可解释性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为公式化Alpha因子挖掘提供了更高效且性能更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Alpha factor mining is pivotal in quantitative investment for identifying
predictive signals from complex financial data. While traditional formulaic
alpha mining relies on human expertise, contemporary automated methods, such as
those based on genetic programming or reinforcement learning, often suffer from
search inefficiency or yield poorly interpretable alpha factors. This paper
introduces a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to overcome these limitations. Our approach
leverages the LLM's instruction-following and reasoning capability to
iteratively generate and refine symbolic alpha formulas within an MCTS-driven
exploration. A key innovation is the guidance of MCTS exploration by rich,
quantitative feedback from financial backtesting of each candidate factor,
enabling efficient navigation of the vast search space. Furthermore, a frequent
subtree avoidance mechanism is introduced to bolster search efficiency and
alpha factor performance. Experimental results on real-world stock market data
demonstrate that our LLM-based framework outperforms existing methods by mining
alphas with superior predictive accuracy, trading performance, and improved
interpretability, while offering a more efficient solution for formulaic alpha
mining.

Result: 进化策略方法在真实数据集上提升了4%的延迟和1%的吞吐量，在简单模型上表现更优。

Conclusion: 进化策略方法在复杂场景中扩展性更好，多样化的训练数据有助于泛化能力。

Abstract: Benchmark datasets are crucial for evaluating approaches to scheduling or
dispatching in the semiconductor industry during the development and deployment
phases. However, commonly used benchmark datasets like the Minifab or SMT2020
lack the complex details and constraints found in real-world scenarios. To
mitigate this shortcoming, we compare open-source simulation models with a real
industry dataset to evaluate how optimization methods scale with different
levels of complexity. Specifically, we focus on Reinforcement Learning methods,
performing optimization based on policy-gradient and Evolution Strategies. Our
research provides insights into the effectiveness of these optimization methods
and their applicability to realistic semiconductor frontend fab simulations. We
show that our proposed Evolution Strategies-based method scales much better
than a comparable policy-gradient-based approach. Moreover, we identify the
selection and combination of relevant bottleneck tools to control by the agent
as crucial for an efficient optimization. For the generalization across
different loading scenarios and stochastic tool failure patterns, we achieve
advantages when utilizing a diverse training dataset. While the overall
approach is computationally expensive, it manages to scale well with the number
of CPU cores used for training. For the real industry dataset, we achieve an
improvement of up to 4% regarding tardiness and up to 1% regarding throughput.
For the less complex open-source models Minifab and SMT2020, we observe
double-digit percentage improvement in tardiness and single digit percentage
improvement in throughput by use of Evolution Strategies.

Conclusion: 结论指出，开放式的设计能发现高性能策略但稳定性差，而引导式设计稳定性高但泛化能力有限。

Abstract: We propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) design to optimize the
charging strategy for autonomous mobile robots in large-scale block stacking
warehouses. RL design involves a wide array of choices that can mostly only be
evaluated through lengthy experimentation. Our study focuses on how different
reward and action space configurations, ranging from flexible setups to more
guided, domain-informed design configurations, affect the agent performance.
Using heuristic charging strategies as a baseline, we demonstrate the
superiority of flexible, RL-based approaches in terms of service times.
Furthermore, our findings highlight a trade-off: While more open-ended designs
are able to discover well-performing strategies on their own, they may require
longer convergence times and are less stable, whereas guided configurations
lead to a more stable learning process but display a more limited
generalization potential. Our contributions are threefold. First, we extend
SLAPStack, an open-source, RL-compatible simulation-framework to accommodate
charging strategies. Second, we introduce a novel RL design for tackling the
charging strategy problem. Finally, we introduce several novel adaptive
baseline heuristics and reproducibly evaluate the design using a Proximal
Policy Optimization agent and varying different design configurations, with a
focus on reward.

Conclusion: FLM是一种简单有效的方法，利用LLMs的语义理解能力提升了组合零样本学习的性能。

Abstract: Humans can easily tell if an attribute (also called state) is realistic,
i.e., feasible, for an object, e.g. fire can be hot, but it cannot be wet. In
Open-World Compositional Zero-Shot Learning, when all possible state-object
combinations are considered as unseen classes, zero-shot predictors tend to
perform poorly. Our work focuses on using external auxiliary knowledge to
determine the feasibility of state-object combinations. Our Feasibility with
Language Model (FLM) is a simple and effective approach that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to better comprehend the semantic relationships between
states and objects. FLM involves querying an LLM about the feasibility of a
given pair and retrieving the output logit for the positive answer. To mitigate
potential misguidance of the LLM given that many of the state-object
compositions are rare or completely infeasible, we observe that the in-context
learning ability of LLMs is essential. We present an extensive study
identifying Vicuna and ChatGPT as best performing, and we demonstrate that our
FLM consistently improves OW-CZSL performance across all three benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI可能传播错误信息和偏见，影响联合国可持续发展目标（SDGs），而现有XAI工具难以处理LLM的非数值特性。

Method: 通过文本到序数映射将非数值输入/输出转换为数值特征，注入不同复杂度的偏见，并测试全局XAI方法（如RuleFit和SHAP）的检测能力。

Result: RuleFit对复杂偏见的检测效果不佳，SHAP能近似检测但无法生成可操作规则。RuleSHAP结合两者，显著提升了检测效果（MRR@1平均提升94%）。

Conclusion: RuleSHAP能更有效地检测LLM中的非单变量偏见，为XAI工具在复杂模型中的应用提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Generative AI systems can help spread information but also misinformation and
biases, potentially undermining the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Explainable AI (XAI) aims to reveal the inner workings of AI systems and expose
misbehaviours or biases. However, current XAI tools, built for simpler models,
struggle to handle the non-numerical nature of large language models (LLMs).
This paper examines the effectiveness of global XAI methods, such as
rule-extraction algorithms and SHAP, in detecting bias in LLMs. To do so, we
first show a text-to-ordinal mapping strategy to convert non-numerical
inputs/outputs into numerical features, enabling these tools to identify (some)
misinformation-related biases in LLM-generated content. Then, we inject
non-linear biases of varying complexity (univariate, conjunctive, and
non-convex) into widespread LLMs like ChatGPT and Llama via system
instructions, using global XAI methods to detect them. This way, we found that
RuleFit struggles with conjunctive and non-convex biases, while SHAP can
approximate conjunctive biases but cannot express them as actionable rules.
Hence, we introduce RuleSHAP, a global rule extraction algorithm combining SHAP
and RuleFit to detect more non-univariate biases, improving injected bias
detection over RuleFit by +94% (MRR@1) on average.

Abstract: As embodied AI systems become increasingly multi-modal, personalized, and
interactive, they must learn effectively from diverse sensory inputs, adapt
continually to user preferences, and operate safely under resource and privacy
constraints. These challenges expose a pressing need for machine learning
models capable of swift, context-aware adaptation while balancing model
generalization and personalization. Here, two methods emerge as suitable
candidates, each offering parts of these capabilities: Foundation Models (FMs)
provide a pathway toward generalization across tasks and modalities, whereas
Federated Learning (FL) offers the infrastructure for distributed,
privacy-preserving model updates and user-level model personalization. However,
when used in isolation, each of these approaches falls short of meeting the
complex and diverse capability requirements of real-world embodied
environments. In this vision paper, we introduce Federated Foundation Models
(FFMs) for embodied AI, a new paradigm that unifies the strengths of
multi-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs with the privacy-preserving distributed nature
of FL, enabling intelligent systems at the wireless edge. We collect critical
deployment dimensions of FFMs in embodied AI ecosystems under a unified
framework, which we name "EMBODY": Embodiment heterogeneity, Modality richness
and imbalance, Bandwidth and compute constraints, On-device continual learning,
Distributed control and autonomy, and Yielding safety, privacy, and
personalization. For each, we identify concrete challenges and envision
actionable research directions. We also present an evaluation framework for
deploying FFMs in embodied AI systems, along with the associated trade-offs.

TL;DR: GLOVA是一种模拟电路尺寸优化框架，通过风险敏感强化学习和集成批评器提高对PVT变化的鲁棒性，显著提升样本效率并减少时间成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟/混合信号电路设计因PVT变化导致性能下降，现有自动化方法未能充分解决实际晶圆中的失配问题。

Method: 采用风险敏感强化学习考虑PVT变化对可靠性边界的影响，引入集成批评器实现高效学习，并提出μ-σ评估和仿真重排序方法降低验证成本。

Result: GLOVA在样本效率上提升80.5倍，时间成本减少76.0倍，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GLOVA有效提升了模拟电路设计的鲁棒性和效率，适用于工业级PVT变化评估。

Abstract: Analog/mixed-signal circuit design encounters significant challenges due to
performance degradation from process, voltage, and temperature (PVT)
variations. To achieve commercial-grade reliability, iterative manual design
revisions and extensive statistical simulations are required. While several
studies have aimed to automate variation aware analog design to reduce
time-to-market, the substantial mismatches in real-world wafers have not been
thoroughly addressed. In this paper, we present GLOVA, an analog circuit sizing
framework that effectively manages the impact of diverse random mismatches to
improve robustness against PVT variations. In the proposed approach,
risk-sensitive reinforcement learning is leveraged to account for the
reliability bound affected by PVT variations, and ensemble-based critic is
introduced to achieve sample-efficient learning. For design verification, we
also propose $\mu$-$\sigma$ evaluation and simulation reordering method to
reduce simulation costs of identifying failed designs. GLOVA supports
verification through industrial-level PVT variation evaluation methods,
including corner simulation as well as global and local Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations. Compared to previous state-of-the-art variation-aware analog
sizing frameworks, GLOVA achieves up to 80.5$\times$ improvement in sample
efficiency and 76.0$\times$ reduction in time.

TL;DR: 研究表明，纯强化学习（RL）训练可提升语言模型的推理能力，无需依赖过程奖励模型（PRM），并提出自监督框架Self-PRM以改进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索纯RL训练是否能替代PRM以提升语言模型的复杂推理能力。

Method: 通过纯RL训练和提出的Self-PRM框架，评估模型在数学问题解决中的表现。

Result: 纯RL训练不仅能提升问题解决能力，还能同步增强PRM能力；Self-PRM在基准测试中表现优于传统PRM，但在难题上精度较低。

Conclusion: PRM可能非必要，纯RL训练足以提升推理能力；未来需进一步优化RL以改进奖励对齐和自监督精度。

Abstract: The development of reasoning capabilities represents a critical frontier in
large language models (LLMs) research, where reinforcement learning (RL) and
process reward models (PRMs) have emerged as predominant methodological
frameworks. Contrary to conventional wisdom, empirical evidence from
DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates that pure RL training focused on mathematical
problem-solving can progressively enhance reasoning abilities without PRM
integration, challenging the perceived necessity of process supervision. In
this study, we conduct a systematic investigation of the relationship between
RL training and PRM capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that problem-solving
proficiency and process supervision capabilities represent complementary
dimensions of reasoning that co-evolve synergistically during pure RL training.
In particular, current PRMs underperform simple baselines like majority voting
when applied to state-of-the-art models such as DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B. To
address this limitation, we propose Self-PRM, an introspective framework in
which models autonomously evaluate and rerank their generated solutions through
self-reward mechanisms. Although Self-PRM consistently improves the accuracy of
the benchmark (particularly with larger sample sizes), analysis exposes
persistent challenges: The approach exhibits low precision (<10\%) on difficult
problems, frequently misclassifying flawed solutions as valid. These analyses
underscore the need for continued RL scaling to improve reward alignment and
introspective accuracy. Overall, our findings suggest that PRM may not be
essential for enhancing complex reasoning, as pure RL not only improves
problem-solving skills but also inherently fosters robust PRM capabilities. We
hope these findings provide actionable insights for building more reliable and
self-aware complex reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全关键场景在现实中罕见且难以收集，现有方法可控性和用户友好性不足。

Method: 利用LDM捕捉真实驾驶轨迹分布，LLM模块将用户查询转化为对抗性损失函数，生成符合需求的场景。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上表现优异，生成场景真实、多样且有效。

Conclusion: LD-Scene提供了细粒度控制，为特定驾驶场景的测试提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and robustness of autonomous driving systems necessitates
a comprehensive evaluation in safety-critical scenarios. However, these
safety-critical scenarios are rare and difficult to collect from real-world
driving data, posing significant challenges to effectively assessing the
performance of autonomous vehicles. Typical existing methods often suffer from
limited controllability and lack user-friendliness, as extensive expert
knowledge is essentially required. To address these challenges, we propose
LD-Scene, a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for user-controllable adversarial scenario
generation through natural language. Our approach comprises an LDM that
captures realistic driving trajectory distributions and an LLM-based guidance
module that translates user queries into adversarial loss functions,
facilitating the generation of scenarios aligned with user queries. The
guidance module integrates an LLM-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) code generator
and an LLM-based code debugger, enhancing the controllability and robustness in
generating guidance functions. Extensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes
dataset demonstrate that LD-Scene achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating realistic, diverse, and effective adversarial scenarios.
Furthermore, our framework provides fine-grained control over adversarial
behaviors, thereby facilitating more effective testing tailored to specific
driving scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型推理模型在处理简单和复杂查询时资源浪费和延迟问题。

Method: 采用双阶段训练：预估计推理成本，引入预算引导的GPRO强化学习。

Result: 在MATH基准测试中实现74.47%的响应长度压缩，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: SelfBudgeter能根据问题复杂度合理分配预算，提升推理效率。

Abstract: Recently, large reasoning models demonstrate exceptional performance on
various tasks. However, reasoning models inefficiently over-process both
trivial and complex queries, leading to resource waste and prolonged user
latency. To address this challenge, we propose SelfBudgeter - a self-adaptive
controllable reasoning strategy for efficient reasoning. Our approach adopts a
dual-phase training paradigm: first, the model learns to pre-estimate the
reasoning cost based on the difficulty of the query. Then, we introduce
budget-guided GPRO for reinforcement learning, which effectively maintains
accuracy while reducing output length. SelfBudgeter allows users to anticipate
generation time and make informed decisions about continuing or interrupting
the process. Furthermore, our method enables direct manipulation of reasoning
length via pre-filling token budget. Experimental results demonstrate that
SelfBudgeter can rationally allocate budgets according to problem complexity,
achieving up to 74.47% response length compression on the MATH benchmark while
maintaining nearly undiminished accuracy.

<details>

Motivation: 日期数据对医疗决策至关重要，但提取方法尚不明确，现有方法（如复杂AI模型或正则表达式）存在局限性。

Method: 测试公开正则表达式，手动创建可分解正则表达式，并使用正则表达式合成自动生成正则表达式。

Result: 正则表达式合成生成的正则表达式误报更少，但漏报略有增加，能有效识别复杂日期和日期范围。

Conclusion: 正则表达式合成是一种新方法，可通过反向工程学习确定性逻辑，提升日期提取的准确性。

Abstract: Dates often contribute towards highly impactful medical decisions, but it is
rarely clear how to extract this data. AI has only just begun to be used
transcribe such documents, and common methods are either to trust that the
output produced by a complex AI model, or to parse the text using regular
expressions. Recent work has established that regular expressions are an
explainable form of logic, but it is difficult to decompose these into the
component parts that are required to construct precise UNIX timestamps. First,
we test publicly-available regular expressions, and we found that these were
unable to capture a significant number of our dates. Next, we manually created
easily-decomposable regular expressions, and we found that these were able to
detect the majority of real dates, but also a lot of sequences of text that
look like dates. Finally, we used regular expression synthesis to automatically
identify regular expressions from the reverse-engineered UNIX timestamps that
we created. We find that regular expressions created by regular expression
synthesis detect far fewer sequences of text that look like dates than those
that were manually created, at the cost of a slight increase to the number of
missed dates. Overall, our results show that regular expressions can be created
through regular expression synthesis to identify complex dates and date ranges
in text transcriptions. To our knowledge, our proposed way of learning
deterministic logic by reverse-engineering several many-one mappings and
feeding these into a regular expression synthesiser is a new approach.

Abstract: A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for
controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures.
Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal
decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning
from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved
confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep
Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm
robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm
attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with
the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and
find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the
observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved
confounders exist.

Result: MOSAAIC框架能有效描述和优化协同创作中的控制权分配。

Conclusion: MOSAAIC为人类与AI协同创作提供了实用的控制权管理工具。

Abstract: Striking the appropriate balance between humans and co-creative AI is an open
research question in computational creativity. Co-creativity, a form of hybrid
intelligence where both humans and AI take action proactively, is a process
that leads to shared creative artifacts and ideas. Achieving a balanced dynamic
in co-creativity requires characterizing control and identifying strategies to
distribute control between humans and AI. We define control as the power to
determine, initiate, and direct the process of co-creation. Informed by a
systematic literature review of 172 full-length papers, we introduce MOSAAIC
(Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in
Co-creation), a novel framework for characterizing and balancing control in
co-creation. MOSAAIC identifies three key dimensions of control: autonomy,
initiative, and authority. We supplement our framework with control
optimization strategies in co-creation. To demonstrate MOSAAIC's applicability,
we analyze the distribution of control in six existing co-creative AI case
studies and present the implications of using this framework.

<details>

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在非西方文化背景下表现有限，需开发更具文化包容性的多模态系统。

Method: 采用半自动化流程，结合GPT-4o生成问题和人工筛选，构建包含丰富文化数据的TCC-Bench基准。

Result: 实验表明当前MLLMs在文化相关视觉内容推理上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究开发文化包容的多模态系统，TCC-Bench为评估提供了工具。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced the ability of artificial intelligence systems to
understand and generate multimodal content. However, these models often exhibit
limited effectiveness when applied to non-Western cultural contexts, which
raises concerns about their wider applicability. To address this limitation, we
propose the \textbf{T}raditional \textbf{C}hinese \textbf{C}ulture
understanding \textbf{Bench}mark (\textbf{TCC-Bench}), a bilingual
(\textit{i.e.}, Chinese and English) Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark
specifically designed for assessing the understanding of traditional Chinese
culture by MLLMs. TCC-Bench comprises culturally rich and visually diverse
data, incorporating images from museum artifacts, everyday life scenes, comics,
and other culturally significant contexts. We adopt a semi-automated pipeline
that utilizes GPT-4o in text-only mode to generate candidate questions,
followed by human curation to ensure data quality and avoid potential data
leakage. The benchmark also avoids language bias by preventing direct
disclosure of cultural concepts within question texts. Experimental evaluations
across a wide range of MLLMs demonstrate that current models still face
significant challenges when reasoning about culturally grounded visual content.
The results highlight the need for further research in developing culturally
inclusive and context-aware multimodal systems. The code and data can be found

Motivation: 随着LLMs融入社会经济互动，需了解人类在战略环境中对LLMs的反应。

Method: 采用货币激励的实验室实验，比较人类在多玩家p-beauty竞赛中对人类和LLMs的行为差异。

Result: 人类在与LLMs对战时选择显著更低的数字，主要受高策略推理能力参与者驱动，且部分人认为LLMs具有合作倾向。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了人类与LLMs互动的行为异质性，为混合系统的机制设计提供了重要启示。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into our social and economic
interactions, we need to deepen our understanding of how humans respond to LLMs
opponents in strategic settings. We present the results of the first controlled
monetarily-incentivised laboratory experiment looking at differences in human
behaviour in a multi-player p-beauty contest against other humans and LLMs. We
use a within-subject design in order to compare behaviour at the individual
level. We show that, in this environment, human subjects choose significantly
lower numbers when playing against LLMs than humans, which is mainly driven by
the increased prevalence of `zero' Nash-equilibrium choices. This shift is
mainly driven by subjects with high strategic reasoning ability. Subjects who
play the zero Nash-equilibrium choice motivate their strategy by appealing to
perceived LLM's reasoning ability and, unexpectedly, propensity towards
cooperation. Our findings provide foundational insights into the multi-player
human-LLM interaction in simultaneous choice games, uncover heterogeneities in
both subjects' behaviour and beliefs about LLM's play when playing against
them, and suggest important implications for mechanism design in mixed
human-LLM systems.

Motivation: 现代神经网络通常对所有输入激活所有神经元，导致计算冗余和效率低下。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MID-L平均减少55%的活跃神经元，节省1.7倍FLOPs，同时保持或提升准确率。

Conclusion: MID-L是一种通用的动态计算层，适用于计算受限系统，填补了dropout正则化和高效推理之间的空白。

Abstract: Modern neural networks often activate all neurons for every input, leading to
unnecessary computation and inefficiency. We introduce Matrix-Interpolated
Dropout Layer (MID-L), a novel module that dynamically selects and activates
only the most informative neurons by interpolating between two transformation
paths via a learned, input-dependent gating vector. Unlike conventional dropout
or static sparsity methods, MID-L employs a differentiable Top-k masking
strategy, enabling per-input adaptive computation while maintaining end-to-end
differentiability. MID-L is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into
existing architectures. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks, including
MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, UCI Adult, and IMDB, show that MID-L achieves
up to average 55\% reduction in active neurons, 1.7$\times$ FLOPs savings, and
maintains or exceeds baseline accuracy. We further validate the informativeness
and selectivity of the learned neurons via Sliced Mutual Information (SMI) and
observe improved robustness under overfitting and noisy data conditions.
Additionally, MID-L demonstrates favorable inference latency and memory usage
profiles, making it suitable for both research exploration and deployment on
compute-constrained systems. These results position MID-L as a general-purpose,
plug-and-play dynamic computation layer, bridging the gap between dropout
regularization and efficient inference.

Motivation: 人类反馈中的噪声偏好会导致奖励模型泛化能力下降，从而在策略优化中提供误导信号。

Result: 实验表明，CRM在40%标签噪声下提升了9.94个准确率点，且与隐式奖励对齐方法兼容。

Conclusion: CRM是一种实用且通用的策略，能显著提升奖励模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are essential for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human values. However, noisy preferences in human feedback often lead to
reward misgeneralization, where RMs overfit to spurious patterns and provide
misleading signals during policy optimization. We systematically analyze the
training dynamics of preference pairs and identify that noisy examples are
harder to fit and introduce instability. Empirical evidence shows that LLMs
optimized using reward models trained on full noisy datasets perform worse than
those trained on filtered, high-quality preferences. To address this, we
propose Collaborative Reward Modeling (CRM), an online framework that enhances
robustness by combining peer review and curriculum learning. Two reward models
are trained in parallel and assess each other's data selections to filter out
potential noise. Curriculum learning structures the preference data from easy
to hard, ensuring synchronized training and stable feedback. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that CRM improves generalization, with up to 9.94
points of accuracy gain on RewardBench under 40 percent label noise. CRM is
also compatible with implicit-reward alignment methods, offering a practical
and versatile strategy for robust alignment.

Motivation: 传统情感TTS方法依赖离散标签，无法准确表达情感的复杂性和连续性，且缺乏大规模平衡数据集。

Result: 实验表明UDDETTS能实现ADV空间的线性情感控制，并具备优越的端到端情感语音合成能力。

Conclusion: UDDETTS为情感TTS提供了更灵活和精确的控制方法，解决了数据不足和情感表达复杂性的挑战。

Abstract: Recent neural codec language models have made great progress in the field of
text-to-speech (TTS), but controllable emotional TTS still faces many
challenges. Traditional methods rely on predefined discrete emotion labels to
control emotion categories and intensities, which can't capture the complexity
and continuity of human emotional perception and expression. The lack of
large-scale emotional speech datasets with balanced emotion distributions and
fine-grained emotion annotations often causes overfitting in synthesis models
and impedes effective emotion control. To address these issues, we propose
UDDETTS, a neural codec language model unifying discrete and dimensional
emotions for controllable emotional TTS. This model introduces the
interpretable Arousal-Dominance-Valence (ADV) space for dimensional emotion
description and supports emotion control driven by either discrete emotion
labels or nonlinearly quantified ADV values. Furthermore, a semi-supervised
training strategy is designed to comprehensively utilize diverse speech
datasets with different types of emotion annotations to train the UDDETTS.
Experiments show that UDDETTS achieves linear emotion control along the three
dimensions of ADV space, and exhibits superior end-to-end emotional speech
synthesis capabilities.

Motivation: 随着物联网网络的快速增长，网络安全风险急剧上升，传统机器学习模型在处理高度不平衡数据时难以准确识别攻击，因此需要开发更有效的入侵检测系统（IDS）。

Method: 采用混合采样技术改善数据不平衡问题，并评估了多种机器学习模型（如随机森林、软投票、SVC、KNN、MLP和逻辑回归）的性能。

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳，Kappa得分为0.9903，测试准确率为0.9961，AUC为0.9994；软投票模型也表现出色，准确率为0.9952，AUC为0.9997。

Conclusion: 混合采样技术与稳健的模型和特征选择相结合，显著提高了物联网在高度不平衡数据环境中的安全性。

Abstract: Due to the rapid growth in the number of Internet of Things (IoT) networks,
the cyber risk has increased exponentially, and therefore, we have to develop
effective IDS that can work well with highly imbalanced datasets. A high rate
of missed threats can be the result, as traditional machine learning models
tend to struggle in identifying attacks when normal data volume is much higher
than the volume of attacks. For example, the dataset used in this study reveals
a strong class imbalance with 94,659 instances of the majority class and only
28 instances of the minority class, making it quite challenging to determine
rare attacks accurately. The challenges presented in this research are
addressed by hybrid sampling techniques designed to improve data imbalance
detection accuracy in IoT domains. After applying these techniques, we evaluate
the performance of several machine learning models such as Random Forest, Soft
Voting, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP), and Logistic Regression with respect to the classification of
cyber-attacks. The obtained results indicate that the Random Forest model
achieved the best performance with a Kappa score of 0.9903, test accuracy of
0.9961, and AUC of 0.9994. Strong performance is also shown by the Soft Voting
model, with an accuracy of 0.9952 and AUC of 0.9997, indicating the benefits of
combining model predictions. Overall, this work demonstrates the value of
hybrid sampling combined with robust model and feature selection for
significantly improving IoT security against cyber-attacks, especially in
highly imbalanced data environments.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer的理论局限性，这些局限性在实际应用中同样存在。

Abstract: Understanding how Transformers work and how they process information is key
to the theoretical and empirical advancement of these machines. In this work,
we demonstrate the existence of two phenomena in Transformers, namely isolation
and continuity. Both of these phenomena hinder Transformers to learn even
simple pattern sequences. Isolation expresses that any learnable sequence must
be isolated from another learnable sequence, and hence some sequences cannot be
learned by a single Transformer at the same time. Continuity entails that an
attractor basin forms around a learned sequence, such that any sequence falling
in that basin will collapse towards the learned sequence. Here, we
mathematically prove these phenomena emerge in all Transformers that use
compact positional encoding, and design rigorous experiments, demonstrating
that the theoretical limitations we shed light on occur on the practical scale.

### [192] [MONAQ: Multi-Objective Neural Architecture Querying for Time-Series Analysis on Resource-Constrained Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10607)
*Patara Trirat,Jae-Gil Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MONAQ是一个基于多目标神经架构查询任务的框架，利用大型语言模型（LLM）解决资源受限硬件上的时间序列分析问题，优于手工模型和NAS基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能手机和物联网设备的普及需要高效的资源受限硬件时间序列分析，但现有硬件感知神经架构搜索（NAS）方法未专注于通用时间序列分析。

Method: MONAQ将NAS重新定义为多目标神经架构查询任务，结合多模态查询生成和基于LLM代理的多目标搜索，通过代码生成实现部署就绪模型。

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验表明，MONAQ发现的模型优于手工模型和NAS基线，且更高效。

Conclusion: MONAQ通过多模态输入和LLM的推理能力，为资源受限硬件上的时间序列分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The growing use of smartphones and IoT devices necessitates efficient
time-series analysis on resource-constrained hardware, which is critical for
sensing applications such as human activity recognition and air quality
prediction. Recent efforts in hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS)
automate architecture discovery for specific platforms; however, none focus on
general time-series analysis with edge deployment. Leveraging the
problem-solving and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLM), we
propose MONAQ, a novel framework that reformulates NAS into Multi-Objective
Neural Architecture Querying tasks. MONAQ is equipped with multimodal query
generation for processing multimodal time-series inputs and hardware
constraints, alongside an LLM agent-based multi-objective search to achieve
deployment-ready models via code generation. By integrating numerical data,
time-series images, and textual descriptions, MONAQ improves an LLM's
understanding of time-series data. Experiments on fifteen datasets demonstrate
that MONAQ-discovered models outperform both handcrafted models and NAS
baselines while being more efficient.

TL;DR: IceMamba是一种结合注意力机制和状态空间模型的深度学习架构，用于季节性海冰预测，优于其他25种模型，尤其在RMSE和ACC指标上表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 北极海冰快速减少对土著社区、生态系统和全球气候系统构成重大风险，亟需精准的季节性海冰预测方法。

Method: 提出IceMamba，一种集成注意力机制和状态空间模型的深度学习架构，并与25种现有预测模型进行比较。

Result: IceMamba在平均RMSE和ACC上表现最佳，IIEE排名第二，优于其他模型。

Conclusion: IceMamba提升了季节性海冰预测能力，为气候适应策略提供了重要支持。

Abstract: The rapid decline of Arctic sea ice resulting from anthropogenic climate
change poses significant risks to indigenous communities, ecosystems, and the
global climate system. This situation emphasizes the immediate necessity for
precise seasonal sea ice forecasts. While dynamical models perform well for
short-term forecasts, they encounter limitations in long-term forecasts and are
computationally intensive. Deep learning models, while more computationally
efficient, often have difficulty managing seasonal variations and uncertainties
when dealing with complex sea ice dynamics. In this research, we introduce
IceMamba, a deep learning architecture that integrates sophisticated attention
mechanisms within the state space model. Through comparative analysis of 25
renowned forecast models, including dynamical, statistical, and deep learning
approaches, our experimental results indicate that IceMamba delivers excellent
seasonal forecasting capabilities for Pan-Arctic sea ice concentration.
Specifically, IceMamba outperforms all tested models regarding average RMSE and
anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) and ranks second in Integrated Ice Edge
Error (IIEE). This innovative approach enhances our ability to foresee and
alleviate the effects of sea ice variability, offering essential insights for
strategies aimed at climate adaptation.

Method: 利用自适应共形预测（CP）监控模型对已学任务的置信度，提出CPCF指标。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上验证了CPCF与任务准确性的强相关性，证明了其可靠性和可解释性。

Conclusion: CPCF是一种稳健且有效的工具，适用于动态学习环境中灾难性遗忘的评估。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel methodology for assessing catastrophic
forgetting (CF) in continual learning. We propose a new conformal prediction
(CP)-based metric, termed the Conformal Prediction Confidence Factor (CPCF), to
quantify and evaluate CF effectively. Our framework leverages adaptive CP to
estimate forgetting by monitoring the model's confidence on previously learned
tasks. This approach provides a dynamic and practical solution for monitoring
and measuring CF of previous tasks as new ones are introduced, offering greater
suitability for real-world applications. Experimental results on four benchmark
datasets demonstrate a strong correlation between CPCF and the accuracy of
previous tasks, validating the reliability and interpretability of the proposed
metric. Our results highlight the potential of CPCF as a robust and effective
tool for assessing and understanding CF in dynamic learning environments.

TL;DR: GNN-Suite是一个模块化框架，用于构建和评估图神经网络（GNN）在计算生物学中的应用，通过标准化实验和可重复性，展示了其在识别癌症驱动基因中的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决计算生物学中GNN架构的标准化和可重复性问题，GNN-Suite旨在提供一个统一的框架，便于比较不同GNN模型的性能。

Method: 使用Nextflow工作流标准化实验，构建分子网络（基于STRING和BioGRID的PPI数据），并标注节点特征（来自PCAWG、PID和COSMIC-CGC）。比较了多种GNN架构（如GAT、GCN等）和基线逻辑回归模型，采用统一的超参数和评估标准（平衡准确率BACC）。

Result: GCN2在STRING网络上的表现最佳（BACC为0.807 ± 0.035），所有GNN模型均优于基线逻辑回归，证明了网络学习的优势。

Conclusion: GNN-Suite为GNN架构的评估提供了通用框架，有助于识别最佳模型和数据整合方式，未来将扩展数据集并优化架构以提高预测性能。

Abstract: We present GNN-Suite, a robust modular framework for constructing and
benchmarking Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures in computational biology.
GNN-Suite standardises experimentation and reproducibility using the Nextflow
workflow to evaluate GNN performance. We demonstrate its utility in identifying
cancer-driver genes by constructing molecular networks from protein-protein
interaction (PPI) data from STRING and BioGRID and annotating nodes with
features from the PCAWG, PID, and COSMIC-CGC repositories.
  Our design enables fair comparisons among diverse GNN architectures including
GAT, GAT3H, GCN, GCN2, GIN, GTN, HGCN, PHGCN, and GraphSAGE and a baseline
Logistic Regression (LR) model. All GNNs were configured as standardised
two-layer models and trained with uniform hyperparameters (dropout = 0.2; Adam
optimiser with learning rate = 0.01; and an adjusted binary cross-entropy loss
to address class imbalance) over an 80/20 train-test split for 300 epochs. Each
model was evaluated over 10 independent runs with different random seeds to
yield statistically robust performance metrics, with balanced accuracy (BACC)
as the primary measure. Notably, GCN2 achieved the highest BACC (0.807 +/-
0.035) on a STRING-based network, although all GNN types outperformed the LR
baseline, highlighting the advantage of network-based learning over
feature-only approaches.
  Our results show that a common framework for implementing and evaluating GNN
architectures aids in identifying not only the best model but also the most
effective means of incorporating complementary data. By making GNN-Suite
publicly available, we aim to foster reproducible research and promote improved
benchmarking standards in computational biology. Future work will explore
additional omics datasets and further refine network architectures to enhance
predictive accuracy and interpretability in biomedical applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LARGO是一种新型的基于梯度的潜在自反射攻击方法，通过在LLM的连续潜在空间中优化，生成流畅且隐蔽的越狱提示，攻击成功率显著高于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的攻击方法在离散语言空间中难以应用梯度优化，因此需要一种更高效的方法来发现LLM的漏洞。

Method: LARGO通过在LLM的连续潜在空间中优化对抗性潜在向量，并递归调用LLM将其解码为自然语言，生成流畅的越狱提示。

Result: 在AdvBench和JailbreakBench基准测试中，LARGO的攻击成功率比现有技术（如AutoDAN）高出44个百分点。

Conclusion: LARGO展示了通过梯度优化攻击LLM内部的有效性，为LLM漏洞挖掘提供了新思路。

Abstract: Efficient red-teaming method to uncover vulnerabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs) is crucial. While recent attacks often use LLMs as optimizers,
the discrete language space make gradient-based methods struggle. We introduce
LARGO (Latent Adversarial Reflection through Gradient Optimization), a novel
latent self-reflection attack that reasserts the power of gradient-based
optimization for generating fluent jailbreaking prompts. By operating within
the LLM's continuous latent space, LARGO first optimizes an adversarial latent
vector and then recursively call the same LLM to decode the latent into natural
language. This methodology yields a fast, effective, and transferable attack
that produces fluent and stealthy prompts. On standard benchmarks like AdvBench
and JailbreakBench, LARGO surpasses leading jailbreaking techniques, including
AutoDAN, by 44 points in attack success rate. Our findings demonstrate a potent
alternative to agentic LLM prompting, highlighting the efficacy of interpreting
and attacking LLM internals through gradient optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络方法仅能建模聚合物的单个单元，无法为具有不同重复单元数的真实聚合物结构生成一致的向量表示。

Method: GRIN结合了基于图的最大生成树对齐和重复单元增强，确保结构一致性，并从模型和数据角度提供了重复不变性的理论保证。

Result: GRIN在均聚物和共聚物基准测试中优于现有方法，能够学习到稳定且重复不变的表示，并能有效推广到未见过的聚合物链大小。

Conclusion: GRIN是一种有效的聚合物表示学习方法，解决了重复单元数变化带来的挑战，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Polymers are large macromolecules composed of repeating structural units
known as monomers and are widely applied in fields such as energy storage,
construction, medicine, and aerospace. However, existing graph neural network
methods, though effective for small molecules, only model the single unit of
polymers and fail to produce consistent vector representations for the true
polymer structure with varying numbers of units. To address this challenge, we
introduce Graph Repetition Invariance (GRIN), a novel method to learn polymer
representations that are invariant to the number of repeating units in their
graph representations. GRIN integrates a graph-based maximum spanning tree
alignment with repeat-unit augmentation to ensure structural consistency. We
provide theoretical guarantees for repetition-invariance from both model and
data perspectives, demonstrating that three repeating units are the minimal
augmentation required for optimal invariant representation learning. GRIN
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both homopolymer and copolymer
benchmarks, learning stable, repetition-invariant representations that
generalize effectively to polymer chains of unseen sizes.

Motivation: 现有方法难以有效结合外源文本与LLM的概率特性，限制了上下文感知和分布建模能力。

Method: CAPTime利用预训练时间序列编码器和可学习交互生成多模态表示，结合混合分布专家和冻结LLM实现概率预测。

Result: 实验表明CAPTime在多模态任务中具有更高的准确性和泛化能力，且在数据稀缺时表现稳健。

Conclusion: CAPTime通过上下文感知和概率解码，显著提升了多模态时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is important for applications spanning energy
markets, climate analysis, and traffic management. However, existing methods
struggle to effectively integrate exogenous texts and align them with the
probabilistic nature of large language models (LLMs). Current approaches either
employ shallow text-time series fusion via basic prompts or rely on
deterministic numerical decoding that conflict with LLMs' token-generation
paradigm, which limits contextual awareness and distribution modeling. To
address these limitations, we propose CAPTime, a context-aware probabilistic
multimodal time series forecasting method that leverages text-informed
abstraction and autoregressive LLM decoding. Our method first encodes temporal
patterns using a pretrained time series encoder, then aligns them with textual
contexts via learnable interactions to produce joint multimodal
representations. By combining a mixture of distribution experts with frozen
LLMs, we enable context-aware probabilistic forecasting while preserving LLMs'
inherent distribution modeling capabilities. Experiments on diverse time series
forecasting tasks demonstrate the superior accuracy and generalization of
CAPTime, particularly in multimodal scenarios. Additional analysis highlights
its robustness in data-scarce scenarios through hybrid probabilistic decoding.

Result: EVA在识别任务（DVS128-Gesture和N-Cars）和检测任务（Gen1数据集47.7 mAP）上表现优异。

Conclusion: EVA为实时事件视觉应用提供了突破性解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras deliver visual data with high temporal resolution, low latency,
and minimal redundancy, yet their asynchronous, sparse sequential nature
challenges standard tensor-based machine learning (ML). While the recent
asynchronous-to-synchronous (A2S) paradigm aims to bridge this gap by
asynchronously encoding events into learned representations for ML pipelines,
existing A2S approaches often sacrifice representation expressivity and
generalizability compared to dense, synchronous methods. This paper introduces
EVA (EVent Asynchronous representation learning), a novel A2S framework to
generate highly expressive and generalizable event-by-event representations.
Inspired by the analogy between events and language, EVA uniquely adapts
advances from language modeling in linear attention and self-supervised
learning for its construction. In demonstration, EVA outperforms prior A2S
methods on recognition tasks (DVS128-Gesture and N-Cars), and represents the
first A2S framework to successfully master demanding detection tasks, achieving
a remarkable 47.7 mAP on the Gen1 dataset. These results underscore EVA's
transformative potential for advancing real-time event-based vision
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏和延迟的奖励函数是RL在现实应用中的主要障碍，需要一种通用且鲁棒的方法来解决。

Method: ARES利用Transformer的注意力机制，基于离线训练的数据集生成密集奖励函数，适用于任何RL算法。

Result: 实验表明，ARES在极端延迟奖励和低质量数据下仍能显著提升RL学习效果。

Conclusion: ARES是首个完全离线、适用于非目标任务的奖励塑形方法，具有广泛适用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Sparse and delayed reward functions pose a significant obstacle for
real-world Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications. In this work, we propose
Attention-based REward Shaping (ARES), a general and robust algorithm which
uses a transformer's attention mechanism to generate shaped rewards and create
a dense reward function for any environment. ARES requires a set of episodes
and their final returns as input. It can be trained entirely offline and is
able to generate meaningful shaped rewards even when using small datasets or
episodes produced by agents taking random actions. ARES is compatible with any
RL algorithm and can handle any level of reward sparsity. In our experiments,
we focus on the most challenging case where rewards are fully delayed until the
end of each episode. We evaluate ARES across a diverse range of environments,
widely used RL algorithms, and baseline methods to assess the effectiveness of
the shaped rewards it produces. Our results show that ARES can significantly
improve learning in delayed reward settings, enabling RL agents to train in
scenarios that would otherwise require impractical amounts of data or even be
unlearnable. To our knowledge, ARES is the first approach that works fully
offline, remains robust to extreme reward delays and low-quality data, and is
not limited to goal-based tasks.

Conclusion: Ready2Unlearn为机器学习模型提供了一种前瞻性遗忘准备策略，为未来更可靠的遗忘方法提供了启发。

Abstract: This paper introduces Ready2Unlearn, a learning-time optimization approach
designed to facilitate future unlearning processes. Unlike the majority of
existing unlearning efforts that focus on designing unlearning algorithms,
which are typically implemented reactively when an unlearning request is made
during the model deployment phase, Ready2Unlearn shifts the focus to the
training phase, adopting a "forward-looking" perspective. Building upon
well-established meta-learning principles, Ready2Unlearn proactively trains
machine learning models with unlearning readiness, such that they are well
prepared and can handle future unlearning requests in a more efficient and
principled manner. Ready2Unlearn is model-agnostic and compatible with any
gradient ascent-based machine unlearning algorithms. We evaluate the method on
both vision and language tasks under various unlearning settings, including
class-wise unlearning and random data unlearning. Experimental results show
that by incorporating such preparedness at training time, Ready2Unlearn
produces an unlearning-ready model state, which offers several key advantages
when future unlearning is required, including reduced unlearning time, improved
retention of overall model capability, and enhanced resistance to the
inadvertent recovery of forgotten data. We hope this work could inspire future
efforts to explore more proactive strategies for equipping machine learning
models with built-in readiness towards more reliable and principled machine
unlearning.

Result: 在视觉导航任务（FrozenLake、Maze、MiniBehavior）中，视觉规划优于纯文本推理方法。

Conclusion: 视觉规划是一种可行且有前景的替代语言推理的方法，为图像推理任务开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) have substantially enhanced machine reasoning across diverse
tasks. However, these models predominantly rely on pure text as the medium for
both expressing and structuring reasoning, even when visual information is
present. In this work, we argue that language may not always be the most
natural or effective modality for reasoning, particularly in tasks involving
spatial and geometrical information. Motivated by this, we propose a new
paradigm, Visual Planning, which enables planning through purely visual
representations, independent of text. In this paradigm, planning is executed
via sequences of images that encode step-by-step inference in the visual
domain, akin to how humans sketch or visualize future actions. We introduce a
novel reinforcement learning framework, Visual Planning via Reinforcement
Learning (VPRL), empowered by GRPO for post-training large vision models,
leading to substantial improvements in planning in a selection of
representative visual navigation tasks, FrozenLake, Maze, and MiniBehavior. Our
visual planning paradigm outperforms all other planning variants that conduct
reasoning in the text-only space. Our results establish Visual Planning as a
viable and promising alternative to language-based reasoning, opening new
avenues for tasks that benefit from intuitive, image-based inference.

Result: 在八个数据集上的实验表明，ImputeINR在高缺失率下表现优异，且能提升下游疾病诊断任务的性能。

Conclusion: ImputeINR为时间序列插值提供了高效解决方案，尤其适用于医疗数据的高缺失率场景。

Abstract: Healthcare data frequently contain a substantial proportion of missing
values, necessitating effective time series imputation to support downstream
disease diagnosis tasks. However, existing imputation methods focus on discrete
data points and are unable to effectively model sparse data, resulting in
particularly poor performance for imputing substantial missing values. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach, ImputeINR, for time series imputation by
employing implicit neural representations (INR) to learn continuous functions
for time series. ImputeINR leverages the merits of INR in that the continuous
functions are not coupled to sampling frequency and have infinite sampling
frequency, allowing ImputeINR to generate fine-grained imputations even on
extremely sparse observed values. Extensive experiments conducted on eight
datasets with five ratios of masked values show the superior imputation
performance of ImputeINR, especially for high missing ratios in time series
data. Furthermore, we validate that applying ImputeINR to impute missing values
in healthcare data enhances the performance of downstream disease diagnosis
tasks. Codes are available.

Result: 实验表明，MultiLink在多类和单类问题上均优于现有方法，且对阈值不敏感。

Conclusion: MultiLink是一种高效、鲁棒的多类结构恢复方法，代码已公开。

Abstract: We address the problem of recovering multiple structures of different classes
in a dataset contaminated by noise and outliers. In particular, we consider
geometric structures defined by a mixture of underlying parametric models (e.g.
planes and cylinders, homographies and fundamental matrices), and we tackle the
robust fitting problem by preference analysis and clustering. We present a new
algorithm, termed MultiLink, that simultaneously deals with multiple classes of
models. MultiLink combines on-the-fly model fitting and model selection in a
novel linkage scheme that determines whether two clusters are to be merged. The
resulting method features many practical advantages with respect to methods
based on preference analysis, being faster, less sensitive to the inlier
threshold, and able to compensate limitations deriving from hypotheses
sampling. Experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that Multi-Link
favourably compares with state of the art alternatives, both in multi-class and
single-class problems. Code is publicly made available for download.

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting anomalies as samples that do not conform

we conceive a general anomaly detection framework called Preference Isolation
Forest (PIF), that combines the benefits of adaptive isolation-based methods
with the flexibility of preference embedding. The key intuition is to embed the
data into a high-dimensional preference space by fitting low-dimensional
manifolds, and to identify anomalies as isolated points. We propose three
isolation approaches to identify anomalies: $i$) Voronoi-iForest, the most
general solution, $ii$) RuzHash-iForest, that avoids explicit computation of
distances via Local Sensitive Hashing, and $iii$) Sliding-PIF, that leverages a
locality prior to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

networks that allows for a computationally efficient input-adaptive rescaling
of the quantization parameters. Our framework applies a probabilistic model to
the network's pre-activations through a lightweight surrogate, enabling the
adaptive adjustment of the quantization parameters on a per-input basis without
significant memory overhead. We validate our approach on a set of popular
computer vision tasks and models, observing only a negligible loss in
performance. Our method strikes the best performance and computational overhead
tradeoff compared to standard quantization strategies.

Conclusion: 该研究为高斯过程在图和单纯复形级别的预测中更广泛应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Predicting the labels of graph-structured data is crucial in scientific
applications and is often achieved using graph neural networks (GNNs). However,
when data is scarce, GNNs suffer from overfitting, leading to poor performance.
Recently, Gaussian processes (GPs) with graph-level inputs have been proposed
as an alternative. In this work, we extend the Gaussian process framework to
simplicial complexes (SCs), enabling the handling of edge-level attributes and
attributes supported on higher-order simplices. We further augment the
resulting SC representations by considering their Hodge decompositions,
allowing us to account for homological information, such as the number of
holes, in the SC. We demonstrate that our framework enhances the predictions
across various applications, paving the way for GPs to be more widely used for
graph and SC-level predictions.

TL;DR: CTP是一种结合CNN、Transformer和PINN的深度学习框架，用于海洋锋面预测，解决了现有方法在空间连续性和物理一致性上的不足，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋锋面在海洋生物地球化学和物理过程中起关键作用，现有方法（如LSTM、ConvLSTM等）在多步预测中难以保持空间连续性和物理一致性。

Method: CTP结合局部空间编码、长程时间注意力和物理约束，整合了CNN、Transformer和PINN的优势。

Result: 在南海和黑潮区域的实验中，CTP在单步和多步预测中均达到SOTA性能，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: CTP通过多架构融合和物理约束，显著提升了海洋锋面预测的准确性和稳定性。

Abstract: This paper proposes CTP, a novel deep learning framework that integrates
convolutional neural network(CNN), Transformer architectures, and
physics-informed neural network(PINN) for ocean front prediction. Ocean fronts,
as dynamic interfaces between distinct water masses, play critical roles in
marine biogeochemical and physical processes. Existing methods such as LSTM,
ConvLSTM, and AttentionConv often struggle to maintain spatial continuity and
physical consistency over multi-step forecasts. CTP addresses these challenges
by combining localized spatial encoding, long-range temporal attention, and
physical constraint enforcement. Experimental results across south China
sea(SCS) and Kuroshio(KUR) regions from 1993 to 2020 demonstrate that CTP
achieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance in both single-step and multi-step
predictions, significantly outperforming baseline models in accuracy, $F_1$
score, and temporal stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种约束偏好贝叶斯优化（CPBO）方法，扩展了偏好贝叶斯优化（PBO），首次引入不等式约束，并通过新提出的获取函数在可行区域内寻找最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实优化任务常涉及不等式约束，但现有PBO方法未解决此问题，因此需要扩展PBO以处理约束条件。

Method: 提出CPBO方法，引入不等式约束，并设计新的获取函数，专注于探索可行区域。

Result: 技术评估显示CPBO能成功识别最优解，实际应用中（如广告设计）通过用户研究验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: CPBO填补了PBO在约束优化中的空白，为实际应用（如设计师参与的广告设计）提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Preferential Bayesian optimization (PBO) is a variant of Bayesian
optimization that observes relative preferences (e.g., pairwise comparisons)
instead of direct objective values, making it especially suitable for
human-in-the-loop scenarios. However, real-world optimization tasks often
involve inequality constraints, which existing PBO methods have not yet
addressed. To fill this gap, we propose constrained preferential Bayesian
optimization (CPBO), an extension of PBO that incorporates inequality
constraints for the first time. Specifically, we present a novel acquisition
function for this purpose. Our technical evaluation shows that our CPBO method
successfully identifies optimal solutions by focusing on exploring feasible
regions. As a practical application, we also present a designer-in-the-loop
system for banner ad design using CPBO, where the objective is the designer's
subjective preference, and the constraint ensures a target predicted
click-through rate. We conducted a user study with professional ad designers,
demonstrating the potential benefits of our approach in guiding creative design
under real-world constraints.

Motivation: 现有图神经网络在捕捉关系数据的复杂结构和长程依赖上存在局限，而传统图变换器在关系实体图上应用时面临位置编码、时间动态性和结构信息丢失等挑战。

Method: RelGT采用多元素标记化策略（特征、类型、跳数距离、时间和局部结构），结合局部子图采样和全局可学习中心点注意力机制。

Result: 在RelBench基准的21个任务中，RelGT性能优于GNN基线达18%。

Conclusion: RelGT证明了图变换器在关系深度学习中的强大潜力。

Abstract: Relational Deep Learning (RDL) is a promising approach for building
state-of-the-art predictive models on multi-table relational data by
representing it as a heterogeneous temporal graph. However, commonly used Graph
Neural Network models suffer from fundamental limitations in capturing complex
structural patterns and long-range dependencies that are inherent in relational
data. While Graph Transformers have emerged as powerful alternatives to GNNs on
general graphs, applying them to relational entity graphs presents unique
challenges: (i) Traditional positional encodings fail to generalize to massive,
heterogeneous graphs; (ii) existing architectures cannot model the temporal
dynamics and schema constraints of relational data; (iii) existing tokenization
schemes lose critical structural information. Here we introduce the Relational
Graph Transformer (RelGT), the first graph transformer architecture designed
specifically for relational tables. RelGT employs a novel multi-element
tokenization strategy that decomposes each node into five components (features,
type, hop distance, time, and local structure), enabling efficient encoding of
heterogeneity, temporality, and topology without expensive precomputation. Our
architecture combines local attention over sampled subgraphs with global
attention to learnable centroids, incorporating both local and database-wide
representations. Across 21 tasks from the RelBench benchmark, RelGT
consistently matches or outperforms GNN baselines by up to 18%, establishing
Graph Transformers as a powerful architecture for Relational Deep Learning.

Conclusion: c-TTv2算法在模拟内存计算中表现出色，解决了现有算法的局限性。

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing is a next-generation computing paradigm that
promises fast, parallel, and energy-efficient deep learning training and
transfer learning (TL). However, achieving this promise has remained elusive
due to a lack of suitable training algorithms. Analog memory devices exhibit
asymmetric and non-linear switching behavior in addition to device-to-device
variation, meaning that most, if not all, of the current off-the-shelf training
algorithms cannot achieve good training outcomes. Also, recently introduced
algorithms have enjoyed limited attention, as they require bi-directionally
switching devices of unrealistically high symmetry and precision and are highly
sensitive. A new algorithm chopped TTv2 (c-TTv2), has been introduced, which
leverages the chopped technique to address many of the challenges mentioned
above. In this paper, we assess the performance of the c-TTv2 algorithm for
analog TL using a Swin-ViT model on a subset of the CIFAR100 dataset. We also
investigate the robustness of our algorithm to changes in some device
specifications, including weight transfer noise, symmetry point skew, and
symmetry point variability

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于群体的强化学习在长时LLM代理训练中信用分配困难，GiGPO旨在解决这一问题。

Method: GiGPO采用两层次结构：宏观轨迹级和微观步骤级信用分配，通过锚状态分组机制实现。

Result: 在ALFWorld和WebShop基准测试中，GiGPO性能提升超过12%和9%，且资源开销不变。

Conclusion: GiGPO有效解决了长时任务中的信用分配问题，同时保持了高效和稳定。

Abstract: Recent advances in group-based reinforcement learning (RL) have driven
frontier large language models (LLMs) in single-turn tasks like mathematical
reasoning. However, their scalability to long-horizon LLM agent training
remains limited. Unlike static tasks, agent-environment interactions unfold
over many steps and often yield sparse or delayed rewards, making credit
assignment across individual steps significantly more challenging. In this
work, we propose Group-in-Group Policy Optimization (GiGPO), a novel RL
algorithm that achieves fine-grained credit assignment for LLM agents while
preserving the appealing properties of group-based RL: critic-free, low memory,
and stable convergence. GiGPO introduces a two-level structure for estimating
relative advantage: (i) At the episode-level, GiGPO computes macro relative
advantages based on groups of complete trajectories; (ii) At the step-level,
GiGPO introduces an anchor state grouping mechanism that retroactively
constructs step-level groups by identifying repeated environment states across
trajectories. Actions stemming from the same state are grouped together,
enabling micro relative advantage estimation. This hierarchical structure
effectively captures both global trajectory quality and local step
effectiveness without relying on auxiliary models or additional rollouts. We
evaluate GiGPO on two challenging agent benchmarks, ALFWorld and WebShop, using
Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Crucially, GiGPO delivers
fine-grained per-step credit signals and achieves performance gains of > 12\%
on ALFWorld and > 9\% on WebShop over the GRPO baseline: all while maintaining
the same GPU memory overhead, identical LLM rollout, and incurring little to no
additional time cost.

Motivation: 扩散模型在捕捉复杂图像分布方面表现出色，但其学习到的数据流形的几何特性尚未得到充分理解。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入基于分数的黎曼度量，利用扩散模型中的Stein分数函数表征数据流形的内在几何特性，并开发高效算法计算测地线。

Result: 在合成数据、Rotated MNIST和自然图像（通过Stable Diffusion）上的实验表明，该方法在LPIPS、FID和KID等指标上优于基线方法，生成更平滑、更真实的图像过渡。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了扩散模型学习到的隐式几何结构，为通过黎曼几何导航自然图像流形提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated their remarkable
ability to capture complex image distributions, but the geometric properties of
the learned data manifold remain poorly understood. We address this gap by
introducing a score-based Riemannian metric that leverages the Stein score
function from diffusion models to characterize the intrinsic geometry of the
data manifold without requiring explicit parameterization. Our approach defines
a metric tensor in the ambient space that stretches distances perpendicular to
the manifold while preserving them along tangential directions, effectively
creating a geometry where geodesics naturally follow the manifold's contours.
We develop efficient algorithms for computing these geodesics and demonstrate
their utility for both interpolation between data points and extrapolation
beyond the observed data distribution. Through experiments on synthetic data
with known geometry, Rotated MNIST, and complex natural images via Stable
Diffusion, we show that our score-based geodesics capture meaningful
transformations that respect the underlying data distribution. Our method
consistently outperforms baseline approaches on perceptual metrics (LPIPS) and
distribution-level metrics (FID, KID), producing smoother, more realistic image
transitions. These results reveal the implicit geometric structure learned by
diffusion models and provide a principled way to navigate the manifold of
natural images through the lens of Riemannian geometry.

Abstract: We propose the first unified adversarial attack benchmark for Genomic
Foundation Models (GFMs), named GenoArmory. Unlike existing GFM benchmarks,
GenoArmory offers the first comprehensive evaluation framework to
systematically assess the vulnerability of GFMs to adversarial attacks.
Methodologically, we evaluate the adversarial robustness of five
state-of-the-art GFMs using four widely adopted attack algorithms and three
defense strategies. Importantly, our benchmark provides an accessible and
comprehensive framework to analyze GFM vulnerabilities with respect to model
architecture, quantization schemes, and training datasets. Additionally, we
introduce GenoAdv, a new adversarial sample dataset designed to improve GFM
safety. Empirically, classification models exhibit greater robustness to
adversarial perturbations compared to generative models, highlighting the
impact of task type on model vulnerability. Moreover, adversarial attacks
frequently target biologically significant genomic regions, suggesting that
these models effectively capture meaningful sequence features.

TL;DR: SNNs通过离散脉冲处理信息，能效高，但主流训练方法（直接编码+BPTT）存在脆弱性，易受分布偏移影响导致崩溃。作者提出DEP方法，通过梯度投影降低Hessian谱半径，提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现SNNs在直接编码和BPTT训练下对分布偏移极度敏感，易崩溃，需解决此问题以提升可靠性。

Method: 提出Dominant Eigencomponent Projection (DEP)，通过正交投影移除梯度主导分量，降低Hessian谱半径。

Result: DEP有效缓解SNNs对异构数据污染的脆弱性，显著提升鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DEP为SNNs的安全可靠部署提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) process information via discrete spikes,
enabling them to operate at remarkably low energy levels. However, our
experimental observations reveal a striking vulnerability when SNNs are trained
using the mainstream method--direct encoding combined with backpropagation
through time (BPTT): even a single backward pass on data drawn from a slightly
different distribution can lead to catastrophic network collapse. Our
theoretical analysis attributes this vulnerability to the repeated inputs
inherent in direct encoding and the gradient accumulation characteristic of
BPTT, which together produce an exceptional large Hessian spectral radius. To
address this challenge, we develop a hyperparameter-free method called Dominant
Eigencomponent Projection (DEP). By orthogonally projecting gradients to
precisely remove their dominant components, DEP effectively reduces the Hessian
spectral radius, thereby preventing SNNs from settling into sharp minima.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DEP not only mitigates the vulnerability
of SNNs to heterogeneous data poisoning, but also significantly enhances
overall robustness compared to key baselines, providing strong support for
safer and more reliable SNN deployment.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of machine-learning models that
operate on graph-structured data. Their expressive power is intimately related
to logics that are invariant under graded bisimilarity. Current proposals for
recurrent GNNs either assume that the graph size is given to the model, or
suffer from a lack of termination guarantees. In this paper, we propose a
halting mechanism for recurrent GNNs. We prove that our halting model can
express all node classifiers definable in graded modal mu-calculus, even for
the standard GNN variant that is oblivious to the graph size. A recent
breakthrough in the study of the expressivity of graded modal mu-calculus in
the finite suggests that conversely, restricted to node classifiers definable
in monadic second-order logic, recurrent GNNs can express only node classifiers
definable in graded modal mu-calculus. To prove our main result, we develop a
new approximate semantics for graded mu-calculus, which we believe to be of
independent interest. We leverage this new semantics into a new model-checking
algorithm, called the counting algorithm, which is oblivious to the graph size.
In a final step we show that the counting algorithm can be implemented on a
halting recurrent GNN.

Conclusion: TSA-SAN通过自适应和注意力机制有效解决了多模式故障诊断问题，具有更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep learning methods have shown promising performance in fault diagnosis for
multimode process. Most existing studies assume that the collected health state
categories from different operating modes are identical. However, in real
industrial scenarios, these categories typically exhibit only partial overlap.
The incompleteness of the available data and the large distributional
differences between the operating modes pose a significant challenge to
existing fault diagnosis methods. To address this problem, a novel fault
diagnosis model named self-adaptive temporal-spatial attention network
(TSA-SAN) is proposed. First, inter-mode mappings are constructed using healthy
category data to generate multimode samples. To enrich the diversity of the
fault data, interpolation is performed between healthy and fault samples.
Subsequently, the fault diagnosis model is trained using real and generated
data. The self-adaptive instance normalization is established to suppress
irrelevant information while retaining essential statistical features for
diagnosis. In addition, a temporal-spatial attention mechanism is constructed
to focus on the key features, thus enhancing the generalization ability of the
model. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The code will be
available on Github at https://github.com/GuangqiangLi/TSA-SAN.

Result: 实验表明，FastKCI在保持统计性能的同时显著提升了计算速度。

Conclusion: FastKCI为大规模数据上的条件独立性测试提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Kernel-based conditional independence (KCI) testing is a powerful
nonparametric method commonly employed in causal discovery tasks. Despite its
flexibility and statistical reliability, cubic computational complexity limits
its application to large datasets. To address this computational bottleneck, we
propose \textit{FastKCI}, a scalable and parallelizable kernel-based
conditional independence test that utilizes a mixture-of-experts approach
inspired by embarrassingly parallel inference techniques for Gaussian
processes. By partitioning the dataset based on a Gaussian mixture model over
the conditioning variables, FastKCI conducts local KCI tests in parallel,
aggregating the results using an importance-weighted sampling scheme.
Experiments on synthetic datasets and benchmarks on real-world production data
validate that FastKCI maintains the statistical power of the original KCI test
while achieving substantial computational speedups. FastKCI thus represents a
practical and efficient solution for conditional independence testing in causal
inference on large-scale data.

Conclusion: BiDist是一种简洁高效的解决方案，通过理论和实验验证其有效性。

Abstract: Population-population generalization is a challenging problem in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL), particularly when agents encounter unseen
co-players. However, existing self-play-based methods are constrained by the
limitation of inside-space generalization. In this study, we propose
Bidirectional Distillation (BiDist), a novel mixed-play framework, to overcome
this limitation in MARL. BiDist leverages knowledge distillation in two
alternating directions: forward distillation, which emulates the historical
policies' space and creates an implicit self-play, and reverse distillation,
which systematically drives agents towards novel distributions outside the
known policy space in a non-self-play manner. In addition, BiDist operates as a
concise and efficient solution without the need for the complex and costly
storage of past policies. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical
evidence to support BiDist's effectiveness. Our results highlight its
remarkable generalization ability across a variety of cooperative, competitive,
and social dilemma tasks, and reveal that BiDist significantly diversifies the
policy distribution space. We also present comprehensive ablation studies to
reinforce BiDist's effectiveness and key success factors. Source codes are
available in the supplementary material.

Abstract: Finding the most similar subsequences between two multidimensional time
series has many applications: e.g. capturing dependency in stock market or
discovering coordinated movement of baboons. Considering one pattern occurring
in one time series, we might be wondering whether the same pattern occurs in
another time series with some distortion that might have a different length.
Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no efficient framework
that deals with this problem yet. In this work, we propose an algorithm that
provides the exact solution of finding the most similar multidimensional
subsequences between time series where there is a difference in length both
between time series and between subsequences. The algorithm is built based on
theoretical guarantee of correctness and efficiency. The result in simulation
datasets illustrated that our approach not just only provided correct solution,
but it also utilized running time only quarter of time compared against the
baseline approaches. In real-world datasets, it extracted the most similar
subsequences even faster (up to 20 times faster against baseline methods) and
provided insights regarding the situation in stock market and following
relations of multidimensional time series of baboon movement. Our approach can
be used for any time series. The code and datasets of this work are provided

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is critical, particularly in
high-stakes domains where biased decisions can lead to serious societal
consequences. Existing preprocessing approaches generally lack transparent
mechanisms for identifying which features or instances are responsible for
unfairness. This obscures the rationale behind data modifications. We introduce
FairSHAP, a novel pre-processing framework that leverages Shapley value
attribution to improve both individual and group fairness. FairSHAP identifies
fairness-critical instances in the training data using an interpretable measure
of feature importance, and systematically modifies them through instance-level
matching across sensitive groups. This process reduces discriminative risk - an
individual fairness metric - while preserving data integrity and model
accuracy. We demonstrate that FairSHAP significantly improves demographic
parity and equality of opportunity across diverse tabular datasets, achieving
fairness gains with minimal data perturbation and, in some cases, improved
predictive performance. As a model-agnostic and transparent method, FairSHAP
integrates seamlessly into existing machine learning pipelines and provides
actionable insights into the sources of bias.Our code is on

*Boris Bonev,Max Rietmann,Andrea Paris,Alberto Carpentieri,Thorsten Kurth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种适用于球面域的广义注意力机制，使Transformer能直接处理球面数据，通过数值积分权重和局部注意力提升性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在气象学、宇宙学和机器人学等领域，保持球面对称性和拓扑结构对物理准确性至关重要，需要一种能处理球面数据的Transformer架构。

Method: 集成数值积分权重到注意力机制中，实现几何精确的球面注意力；提出局部注意力以减少计算复杂度并保留对称性。

Result: 在模拟浅水方程、球面图像分割和深度估计任务中，球面Transformer性能优于平面方法。

Conclusion: 球面Transformer通过几何先验在球面域学习中具有显著优势，且通过优化实现实用化。

Abstract: We introduce a generalized attention mechanism for spherical domains,
enabling Transformer architectures to natively process data defined on the
two-dimensional sphere - a critical need in fields such as atmospheric physics,
cosmology, and robotics, where preserving spherical symmetries and topology is
essential for physical accuracy. By integrating numerical quadrature weights
into the attention mechanism, we obtain a geometrically faithful spherical
attention that is approximately rotationally equivariant, providing strong
inductive biases and leading to better performance than Cartesian approaches.
To further enhance both scalability and model performance, we propose
neighborhood attention on the sphere, which confines interactions to geodesic
neighborhoods. This approach reduces computational complexity and introduces
the additional inductive bias for locality, while retaining the symmetry
properties of our method. We provide optimized CUDA kernels and
memory-efficient implementations to ensure practical applicability. The method
is validated on three diverse tasks: simulating shallow water equations on the
rotating sphere, spherical image segmentation, and spherical depth estimation.
Across all tasks, our spherical Transformers consistently outperform their
planar counterparts, highlighting the advantage of geometric priors for
learning on spherical domains.

*Hangyu Zhou,Aaron Gokaslan,Volodymyr Kuleshov,Bharath Hariharan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过随机正交变换减少模型合并中任务干扰的方法，显著提升了性能，同时支持高效的多模型服务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型合并虽然可以实现多模型的高效内存服务，但由于任务特定参数调整（即增量）之间的干扰，性能会下降。

Method: 将模型合并重新定义为压缩-检索方案，并使用随机正交变换将增量向量去相关，以减少干扰。

Result: 该方法显著减少了干扰，在视觉和语言任务中均提升了性能，且无需额外内存即可添加新模型。

Conclusion: 随机正交变换的数据和模型无关性支持高效灵活的多模型服务，具有低计算开销。

Abstract: From a multi-model compression perspective, model merging enables
memory-efficient serving of multiple models fine-tuned from the same base, but
suffers from degraded performance due to interference among their task-specific
parameter adjustments (i.e., deltas). In this paper, we reformulate model
merging as a compress-and-retrieve scheme, revealing that the task interference
arises from the summation of irrelevant deltas during model retrieval. To
address this issue, we use random orthogonal transformations to decorrelate
these vectors into self-cancellation. We show that this approach drastically
reduces interference, improving performance across both vision and language
tasks. Since these transformations are fully defined by random seeds, adding
new models requires no extra memory. Further, their data- and model-agnostic
nature enables easy addition or removal of models with minimal compute
overhead, supporting efficient and flexible multi-model serving.

TL;DR: BHIP通过层次贝叶斯重构ICP，提升计算可扩展性，并利用先验信息，测试了两种稀疏先验，验证了其作为ICP替代方法的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ICP在异质数据下因果机制不变性测试的局限性，并提升计算效率。

Method: 采用层次贝叶斯框架，测试马靴和钉板两种稀疏先验，验证因果特征识别的可靠性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据中验证了BHIP的优越性，尤其是在多预测变量场景下的表现。

Conclusion: BHIP是一种有效的ICP替代方法，具备更好的计算可扩展性和先验信息利用能力。

Abstract: We propose Bayesian Hierarchical Invariant Prediction (BHIP) reframing
Invariant Causal Prediction (ICP) through the lens of Hierarchical Bayes. We
leverage the hierarchical structure to explicitly test invariance of causal
mechanisms under heterogeneous data, resulting in improved computational
scalability for a larger number of predictors compared to ICP. Moreover, given
its Bayesian nature BHIP enables the use of prior information. In this paper,
we test two sparsity inducing priors: horseshoe and spike-and-slab, both of
which allow us a more reliable identification of causal features. We test BHIP
in synthetic and real-world data showing its potential as an alternative
inference method to ICP.

### [226] [A Set-Sequence Model for Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11243)
*Elliot L. Epstein,Apaar Sadhwani,Kay Giesecke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种Set-Sequence模型，用于金融预测问题，无需手工特征，通过共享的跨截面摘要和时间序列预测单元结果，显著优于基准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖手工特征捕捉潜在跨截面效应，效率低且不灵活。

Method: Set模型学习共享跨截面摘要，Sequence模型独立处理摘要增强的时间序列预测结果，两者联合学习。

Result: 在股票回报预测和抵押贷款行为任务中显著优于基准方法。

Conclusion: Set-Sequence模型高效灵活，适用于金融预测问题。

Abstract: In many financial prediction problems, the behavior of individual units (such
as loans, bonds, or stocks) is influenced by observable unit-level factors and
macroeconomic variables, as well as by latent cross-sectional effects.
Traditional approaches attempt to capture these latent effects via handcrafted
summary features. We propose a Set-Sequence model that eliminates the need for
handcrafted features. The Set model first learns a shared cross-sectional
summary at each period. The Sequence model then ingests the summary-augmented
time series for each unit independently to predict its outcome. Both components
are learned jointly over arbitrary sets sampled during training. Our approach
harnesses the set nature of the cross-section and is computationally efficient,
generating set summaries in linear time relative to the number of units. It is
also flexible, allowing the use of existing sequence models and accommodating a
variable number of units at inference. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that
our Set-Sequence model significantly outperforms benchmarks on stock return
prediction and mortgage behavior tasks. Code will be released.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了联邦学习中通信和计算异构性如何共同导致目标不一致性，并提出了一种通用方法FedACS来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端的通信和计算能力差异会导致优化动态失真和目标不一致性，这一问题尚未被深入研究。

Method: 提出FedACS方法，通过异构感知的客户端采样消除目标不一致性。

Result: FedACS在动态异构环境中以$O(1/\sqrt{R})$的速率收敛，实验显示其性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedACS是一种通用且高效的方法，能够显著提升联邦学习的性能并降低通信和计算成本。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) commonly involves clients with diverse communication
and computational capabilities. Such heterogeneity can significantly distort
the optimization dynamics and lead to objective inconsistency, where the global
model converges to an incorrect stationary point potentially far from the
pursued optimum. Despite its critical impact, the joint effect of communication
and computation heterogeneity has remained largely unexplored, due to the
intrinsic complexity of their interaction. In this paper, we reveal the
fundamentally distinct mechanisms through which heterogeneous communication and
computation drive inconsistency in FL. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first unified theoretical analysis of general heterogeneous FL, offering a
principled understanding of how these two forms of heterogeneity jointly
distort the optimization trajectory under arbitrary choices of local solvers.
Motivated by these insights, we propose Federated Heterogeneity-Aware Client
Sampling, FedACS, a universal method to eliminate all types of objective
inconsistency. We theoretically prove that FedACS converges to the correct
optimum at a rate of $O(1/\sqrt{R})$, even in dynamic heterogeneous
environments. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets show that FedACS
outperforms state-of-the-art and category-specific baselines by 4.3%-36%, while
reducing communication costs by 22%-89% and computation loads by 14%-105%,
respectively.

TL;DR: Mergenetic是一个开源库，支持通过进化算法合并语言模型，提供灵活的实验框架和轻量级评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架缺乏支持进化算法与模型合并的灵活实验工具，Mergenetic填补了这一空白。

Method: 结合模型合并方法与进化算法，并引入轻量级适应度评估器以降低成本。

Result: Mergenetic在多种任务和语言中表现优异，且硬件需求低。

Conclusion: Mergenetic为模型合并提供了高效、灵活的实验工具，适用于资源有限的环境。

Abstract: Model merging allows combining the capabilities of existing models into a new
one - post hoc, without additional training. This has made it increasingly
popular thanks to its low cost and the availability of libraries that support
merging on consumer GPUs. Recent work shows that pairing merging with
evolutionary algorithms can boost performance, but no framework currently
supports flexible experimentation with such strategies in language models. We
introduce Mergenetic, an open-source library for evolutionary model merging.
Mergenetic enables easy composition of merging methods and evolutionary
algorithms while incorporating lightweight fitness estimators to reduce
evaluation costs. We describe its design and demonstrate that Mergenetic
produces competitive results across tasks and languages using modest hardware.

*Omar Shaikh,Shardul Sapkota,Shan Rizvi,Eric Horvitz,Joon Sung Park,Diyi Yang,Michael S. Bernstein*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通用用户模型（GUM）架构，通过观察用户与计算机的交互学习用户偏好和行为，支持多模态推理，并展示了其在聊天助手、通知管理和交互代理中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用户模型局限于特定应用，无法实现灵活推理。GUM旨在通过多模态观察构建通用用户知识，实现更智能的人机交互。

Method: GUM通过输入非结构化用户观察（如设备截图），生成置信度加权的用户知识命题，支持多模态推理和动态更新。

Result: GUM能准确推断用户需求，并支持主动助手（GUMBO）执行用户未明确请求的操作。

Conclusion: GUM为实现长期HCI愿景提供了方法，支持新型交互系统预测用户需求。

Abstract: Human-computer interaction has long imagined technology that understands
us-from our preferences and habits, to the timing and purpose of our everyday
actions. Yet current user models remain fragmented, narrowly tailored to
specific apps, and incapable of the flexible reasoning required to fulfill
these visions. This paper presents an architecture for a general user model
(GUM) that learns about you by observing any interaction you have with your
computer. The GUM takes as input any unstructured observation of a user (e.g.,
device screenshots) and constructs confidence-weighted propositions that
capture that user knowledge and preferences. GUMs can infer that a user is
preparing for a wedding they're attending from messages with a friend. Or
recognize that a user is struggling with a collaborator's feedback on a draft
by observing multiple stalled edits and a switch to reading related work. GUMs
introduce an architecture that infers new propositions about a user from
multimodal observations, retrieves related propositions for context, and
continuously revises existing propositions. To illustrate the breadth of
applications that GUMs enable, we demonstrate how they augment chat-based
assistants with context, manage OS notifications to selectively surface
important information, and enable interactive agents that adapt to preferences
across apps. We also instantiate proactive assistants (GUMBOs) that discover
and execute useful suggestions on a user's behalf using their GUM. In our
evaluations, we find that GUMs make calibrated and accurate inferences about
users, and that assistants built on GUMs proactively identify and perform
actions that users wouldn't think to request explicitly. Altogether, GUMs
introduce methods that leverage multimodal models to understand unstructured
context, enabling long-standing visions of HCI and entirely new interactive
systems that anticipate user needs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI工具如何通过协同写作影响人们的自我感知和控制点。

Method: 通过462名参与者的实证研究，结合定量和定性分析。

Result: 就业者更依赖AI且控制点内化，失业者个人能动性降低。

Conclusion: 研究引发关于AI如何塑造个人能动性和身份的广泛讨论。

Abstract: As AI tools increasingly shape how we write, they may also quietly reshape
how we perceive ourselves. This paper explores the psychological impact of
co-writing with AI on people's locus of control. Through an empirical study
with 462 participants, we found that employment status plays a critical role in
shaping users' reliance on AI and their locus of control. Current results
demonstrated that employed participants displayed higher reliance on AI and a
shift toward internal control, while unemployed users tended to experience a
reduction in personal agency. Through quantitative results and qualitative
observations, this study opens a broader conversation about AI's role in
shaping personal agency and identity.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新数据集和评估基准，用于评估和改进可部署在边缘设备上的小型语言模型，重点是智能家居环境中多会话自然语言交互的用户画像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型语言模型在用户行为建模中的性能不足问题，同时保护用户隐私并实现低延迟的个性化体验。

Method: 利用结构化用户画像生成模拟交互会话，通过大型语言模型生成多样化的对话数据，并评估小型模型在用户画像重建任务中的表现。

Result: 小型模型在用户画像重建任务中表现有限，显著落后于大型模型，但边缘设备处理具有隐私和延迟优势。

Conclusion: 该数据集为开发隐私保护的智能系统提供了重要基础，推动在用户设备上直接学习和适应的AI技术发展。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to
assess and improve small language models deployable on edge devices, with a
focus on user profiling from multi-session natural language interactions in
smart home environments. At the core of the dataset are structured user
profiles, each defined by a set of routines - context-triggered, repeatable
patterns of behavior that govern how users interact with their home systems.
Using these profiles as input, a large language model (LLM) generates
corresponding interaction sessions that simulate realistic, diverse, and
context-aware dialogues between users and their devices.
  The primary task supported by this dataset is profile reconstruction:
inferring user routines and preferences solely from interactions history. To
assess how well current models can perform this task under realistic
conditions, we benchmarked several state-of-the-art compact language models and
compared their performance against large foundation models. Our results show
that while small models demonstrate some capability in reconstructing profiles,
they still fall significantly short of large models in accurately capturing
user behavior. This performance gap poses a major challenge - particularly
because on-device processing offers critical advantages, such as preserving
user privacy, minimizing latency, and enabling personalized experiences without
reliance on the cloud. By providing a realistic, structured testbed for
developing and evaluating behavioral modeling under these constraints, our
dataset represents a key step toward enabling intelligent, privacy-respecting
AI systems that learn and adapt directly on user-owned devices.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在材料科学工具应用中的能力，推动更有效的AI系统开发。

Method: 构建MatTools，包括基于pymatgen的QA基准和实际任务基准，自动化收集数据并评估LLMs。

Result: 发现通用模型优于专用模型，AI对AI更了解，简单方法更有效。

Conclusion: MatTools为评估和改进LLMs在材料科学中的应用提供了标准化框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to materials science
questions, including literature comprehension, property prediction, materials
discovery and alloy design. At the same time, a wide range of physics-based
computational approaches have been developed in which materials properties can
be calculated. Here, we propose a benchmark application to evaluate the
proficiency of LLMs to answer materials science questions through the
generation and safe execution of codes based on such physics-based
computational materials science packages. MatTools is built on two
complementary components: a materials simulation tool question-answer (QA)
benchmark and a real-world tool-usage benchmark. We designed an automated
methodology to efficiently collect real-world materials science tool-use
examples. The QA benchmark, derived from the pymatgen (Python Materials
Genomics) codebase and documentation, comprises 69,225 QA pairs that assess the
ability of an LLM to understand materials science tools. The real-world
benchmark contains 49 tasks (138 subtasks) requiring the generation of
functional Python code for materials property calculations. Our evaluation of
diverse LLMs yields three key insights: (1)Generalists outshine
specialists;(2)AI knows AI; and (3)Simpler is better. MatTools provides a
standardized framework for assessing and improving LLM capabilities for
materials science tool applications, facilitating the development of more
effective AI systems for materials science and general scientific research.

Conclusion: SGEquiDiff为晶体材料设计提供了高效且符合对称性约束的解决方案。

Abstract: Accelerating inverse design of crystalline materials with generative models
has significant implications for a range of technologies. Unlike other atomic
systems, 3D crystals are invariant to discrete groups of isometries called the
space groups. Crucially, these space group symmetries are known to heavily
influence materials properties. We propose SGEquiDiff, a crystal generative
model which naturally handles space group constraints with space group
invariant likelihoods. SGEquiDiff consists of an SE(3)-invariant, telescoping
discrete sampler of crystal lattices; permutation-invariant, transformer-based
autoregressive sampling of Wyckoff positions, elements, and numbers of
symmetrically unique atoms; and space group equivariant diffusion of atomic
coordinates. We show that space group equivariant vector fields automatically
live in the tangent spaces of the Wyckoff positions. SGEquiDiff achieves
state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmark datasets as assessed by
quantitative proxy metrics and quantum mechanical calculations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Audio deepfake detection (ADD) has grown increasingly important due to the
rise of high-fidelity audio generative models and their potential for misuse.
Given that audio large language models (ALLMs) have made significant progress
in various audio processing tasks, a heuristic question arises: Can ALLMs be
leveraged to solve ADD?. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive
zero-shot evaluation of ALLMs on ADD, revealing their ineffectiveness in
detecting fake audio. To enhance their performance, we propose
$\mathcal{A}LLM4ADD$, an ALLM-driven framework for ADD. Specifically, we
reformulate ADD task as an audio question answering problem, prompting the
model with the question: "Is this audio fake or real?". We then perform
supervised fine-tuning to enable the ALLM to assess the authenticity of query
audio. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our ALLM-based
method can achieve superior performance in fake audio detection, particularly
in data-scarce scenarios. As a pioneering study, we anticipate that this work
will inspire the research community to leverage ALLMs to develop more effective
ADD systems.

Motivation: 现有TTS系统评估方法（如MOS）存在主观性和环境不一致等问题，且数据集缺乏多维度设计，尤其在中文TTS评估中表现明显。

Method: 引入ATT-Corpus数据集和基于图灵测试的简化评估协议，同时微调Qwen2-Audio-Instruct模型作为自动评估工具Auto-ATT。

Result: ATT能有效区分模型在特定能力维度的表现，Auto-ATT与人工评估高度一致，验证了其快速可靠的评估价值。

Conclusion: ATT和Auto-ATT为TTS系统提供了更客观、多维度且高效的评估方案，推动了模型开发的进步。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved
text-to-speech (TTS) systems, enhancing control over speech style, naturalness,
and emotional expression, which brings TTS Systems closer to human-level
performance. Although the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) remains the standard for TTS
System evaluation, it suffers from subjectivity, environmental inconsistencies,
and limited interpretability. Existing evaluation datasets also lack a
multi-dimensional design, often neglecting factors such as speaking styles,
context diversity, and trap utterances, which is particularly evident in
Chinese TTS evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce the Audio
Turing Test (ATT), a multi-dimensional Chinese corpus dataset ATT-Corpus paired
with a simple, Turing-Test-inspired evaluation protocol. Instead of relying on
complex MOS scales or direct model comparisons, ATT asks evaluators to judge
whether a voice sounds human. This simplification reduces rating bias and
improves evaluation robustness. To further support rapid model development, we
also finetune Qwen2-Audio-Instruct with human judgment data as Auto-ATT for
automatic evaluation. Experimental results show that ATT effectively
differentiates models across specific capability dimensions using its
multi-dimensional design. Auto-ATT also demonstrates strong alignment with
human evaluations, confirming its value as a fast and reliable assessment tool.
The white-box ATT-Corpus and Auto-ATT can be found in ATT Hugging Face

Abstract: Imagine hearing a dog bark and turning toward the sound only to see a parked
car, while the real, silent dog sits elsewhere. Such sensory conflicts test
perception, yet humans reliably resolve them by prioritizing sound over
misleading visuals. Despite advances in multimodal AI integrating vision and
audio, little is known about how these systems handle cross-modal conflicts or
whether they favor one modality. In this study, we systematically examine
modality bias and conflict resolution in AI sound localization. We assess
leading multimodal models and benchmark them against human performance in
psychophysics experiments across six audiovisual conditions, including
congruent, conflicting, and absent cues. Humans consistently outperform AI,
demonstrating superior resilience to conflicting or missing visuals by relying
on auditory information. In contrast, AI models often default to visual input,
degrading performance to near chance levels. To address this, we finetune a
state-of-the-art model using a stereo audio-image dataset generated via 3D
simulations. Even with limited training data, the refined model surpasses
existing benchmarks. Notably, it also mirrors human-like horizontal
localization bias favoring left-right precision-likely due to the stereo audio
structure reflecting human ear placement. These findings underscore how sensory
input quality and system architecture shape multimodal representation accuracy.

TL;DR: Vaiage是一个基于多智能体和大型语言模型的旅行规划系统，通过自然语言交互和实时反馈优化行程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统旅行规划平台缺乏动态适应性和实时交互能力，无法满足用户个性化需求。

Method: 采用图结构多智能体框架，结合大型语言模型进行目标推荐和行程规划，支持自然语言交互和实时约束调整。

Result: Vaiage在实验中平均得分8.5/10，优于无策略（7.2）和无外部API（6.8）的变体，显著提升了行程可行性。

Conclusion: 结合大型语言模型推理与符号化智能体协调，Vaiage在开放式现实规划任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Planning trips is a cognitively intensive task involving conflicting user
preferences, dynamic external information, and multi-step temporal-spatial
optimization. Traditional platforms often fall short - they provide static
results, lack contextual adaptation, and fail to support real-time interaction
or intent refinement.
  Our approach, Vaiage, addresses these challenges through a graph-structured
multi-agent framework built around large language models (LLMs) that serve as
both goal-conditioned recommenders and sequential planners. LLMs infer user
intent, suggest personalized destinations and activities, and synthesize
itineraries that align with contextual constraints such as budget, timing,
group size, and weather. Through natural language interaction, structured tool
use, and map-based feedback loops, Vaiage enables adaptive, explainable, and
end-to-end travel planning grounded in both symbolic reasoning and
conversational understanding.
  To evaluate Vaiage, we conducted human-in-the-loop experiments using
rubric-based GPT-4 assessments and qualitative feedback. The full system
achieved an average score of 8.5 out of 10, outperforming the no-strategy (7.2)

Motivation: MARL在复杂军事场景中具有潜力，但缺乏可解释性限制了其实际部署，尤其是在需要信任和安全性的敏感环境中。

Method: 研究回顾并评估了现有的MARL可解释性方法，并将其应用于模拟空战场景，以获取模型行为的解释性见解。

Conclusion: 研究强调了可解释性在推动MARL用于防御作战中的关键作用，不仅支持战略规划，还为军事人员提供了清晰易懂的分析。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping strategic planning, with
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) enabling coordination among
autonomous agents in complex scenarios. However, its practical deployment in
sensitive military contexts is constrained by the lack of explainability, which
is an essential factor for trust, safety, and alignment with human strategies.
This work reviews and assesses current advances in explainability methods for
MARL with a focus on simulated air combat scenarios. We proceed by adapting
various explainability techniques to different aerial combat scenarios to gain
explanatory insights about the model behavior. By linking AI-generated tactics
with human-understandable reasoning, we emphasize the need for transparency to
ensure reliable deployment and meaningful human-machine interaction. By
illuminating the crucial importance of explainability in advancing MARL for
operational defense, our work supports not only strategic planning but also the
training of military personnel with insightful and comprehensible analyses.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于场的纹理网格质量评估方法（FMQM），通过几何和颜色场提取视觉感知特征，优于现有方法且计算复杂度低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有纹理网格质量评估方法（TMQA）准确性不足，受场表示3D几何和颜色信息的启发，提出新方法。

Method: 利用有符号距离场和新提出的最近表面点颜色场提取几何相似性、几何梯度相似性、空间颜色分布相似性和空间颜色梯度相似性。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，计算复杂度低。

Conclusion: FMQM是一种高效实用的纹理网格质量评估方法，适用于3D图形和可视化应用。

Abstract: Textured mesh quality assessment (TMQA) is critical for various 3D mesh
applications. However, existing TMQA methods often struggle to provide accurate
and robust evaluations. Motivated by the effectiveness of fields in
representing both 3D geometry and color information, we propose a novel
point-based TMQA method called field mesh quality metric (FMQM). FMQM utilizes
signed distance fields and a newly proposed color field named nearest surface
point color field to realize effective mesh feature description. Four features
related to visual perception are extracted from the geometry and color fields:
geometry similarity, geometry gradient similarity, space color distribution
similarity, and space color gradient similarity. Experimental results on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate that FMQM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
TMQA metrics. Furthermore, FMQM exhibits low computational complexity, making
it a practical and efficient solution for real-world applications in 3D
graphics and visualization. Our code is publicly available at:

*Chiyue Wei,Bowen Duan,Cong Guo,Jingyang Zhang,Qingyue Song,Hai "Helen" Li,Yiran Chen*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Phi的基于模式的分层稀疏框架，通过利用脉冲激活中的特定模式，显著减少了SNN模型的计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SNN加速器虽然利用了0-1激活稀疏性，但忽略了二进制激活中的独特分布模式。

Method: Phi采用两级稀疏层次：第一级通过预定义模式表示激活，离线预计算以减少运行时计算；第二级通过高度稀疏矩阵进一步减少计算。算法上使用k-means模式选择和模式感知微调技术，硬件上设计了专用架构Phi。

Result: 实验表明，Phi在速度和能效上分别比现有SNN加速器提高了3.45倍和4.93倍。

Conclusion: Phi框架通过模式分层稀疏性有效优化了SNN计算，展示了算法-硬件协同设计的优势。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are gaining attention for their energy
efficiency and biological plausibility, utilizing 0-1 activation sparsity
through spike-driven computation. While existing SNN accelerators exploit this
sparsity to skip zero computations, they often overlook the unique distribution
patterns inherent in binary activations. In this work, we observe that
particular patterns exist in spike activations, which we can utilize to reduce
the substantial computation of SNN models. Based on these findings, we propose
a novel \textbf{pattern-based hierarchical sparsity} framework, termed
\textbf{\textit{Phi}}, to optimize computation.
  \textit{Phi} introduces a two-level sparsity hierarchy: Level 1 exhibits
vector-wise sparsity by representing activations with pre-defined patterns,
allowing for offline pre-computation with weights and significantly reducing
most runtime computation. Level 2 features element-wise sparsity by
complementing the Level 1 matrix, using a highly sparse matrix to further
reduce computation while maintaining accuracy. We present an algorithm-hardware
co-design approach. Algorithmically, we employ a k-means-based pattern
selection method to identify representative patterns and introduce a
pattern-aware fine-tuning technique to enhance Level 2 sparsity.
Architecturally, we design \textbf{\textit{Phi}}, a dedicated hardware
architecture that efficiently processes the two levels of \textit{Phi} sparsity
on the fly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textit{Phi} achieves a
$3.45\times$ speedup and a $4.93\times$ improvement in energy efficiency
compared to state-of-the-art SNN accelerators, showcasing the effectiveness of
our framework in optimizing SNN computation.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于“Ghost特征”的方法，以减少视频超分辨率（VSR）模型中的特征冗余，并结合RNN解决梯度消失问题，提升了PSNR和SSIM指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代基于CNN的VSR系统计算成本高，且存在特征冗余问题，但此问题在VSR领域较少讨论。

Method: 提出使用“Ghost特征”减少冗余，并结合RNN建模时间序列，输入包括当前帧、下一帧、前一帧输出和隐藏状态。

Result: 在多个基准模型和数据集上实验表明，PSNR和SSIM有所提升，视频纹理细节保留更好。

Conclusion: 结合Ghost特征和RNN的方法有效减少了冗余并提升了视频超分辨率的质量。

Abstract: Modern video super-resolution (VSR) systems based on convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) require huge computational costs. The problem of feature
redundancy is present in most models in many domains, but is rarely discussed
in VSR. We experimentally observe that many features in VSR models are also
similar to each other, so we propose to use "Ghost features" to reduce this
redundancy. We also analyze the so-called "gradient disappearance" phenomenon
generated by the conventional recurrent convolutional network (RNN) model, and
combine the Ghost module with RNN to complete the modeling on time series. The
current frame is used as input to the model together with the next frame, the
output of the previous frame and the hidden state. Extensive experiments on
several benchmark models and datasets show that the PSNR and SSIM of our
proposed modality are improved to some extent. Some texture details in the
video are also better preserved.

Conclusion: 深度学习方法在PASC相关肺纤维化的早期检测和风险评估中具有潜力，为首次提出此类研究。

Abstract: While the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, its long-term
effects persist through Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), commonly known
as Long COVID. There remains substantial uncertainty regarding both its
duration and optimal management strategies. PASC manifests as a diverse array
of persistent or newly emerging symptoms--ranging from fatigue, dyspnea, and
neurologic impairments (e.g., brain fog), to cardiovascular, pulmonary, and
musculoskeletal abnormalities--that extend beyond the acute infection phase.
This heterogeneous presentation poses substantial challenges for clinical
assessment, diagnosis, and treatment planning. In this paper, we focus on
imaging findings that may suggest fibrotic damage in the lungs, a critical
manifestation characterized by scarring of lung tissue, which can potentially
affect long-term respiratory function in patients with PASC. This study
introduces a novel multi-center chest CT analysis framework that combines deep
learning and radiomics for fibrosis prediction. Our approach leverages
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and interpretable feature extraction,
achieving 82.2% accuracy and 85.5% AUC in classification tasks. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of Grad-CAM visualization and radiomics-based feature
analysis in providing clinically relevant insights for PASC-related lung
fibrosis prediction. Our findings highlight the potential of deep
learning-driven computational methods for early detection and risk assessment
of PASC-related lung fibrosis--presented for the first time in the literature.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的解剖感知切片选择方法，用于高效多器官分割，并引入新指标SLC评估定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D分割方法计算和内存消耗高，以及2D方法缺乏跨视图上下文感知的问题。

Method: 使用VLM融合三视图（2.5D）表示进行器官存在检测，选择性保留结构相关切片。

Result: 模型在多个器官上显著优于基线方法，实现了高效且空间一致的器官切片过滤。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低下游分割成本，同时保持高解剖保真度。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate multi-organ segmentation from abdominal CT volumes is
a fundamental challenge in medical image analysis. Existing 3D segmentation
approaches are computationally and memory intensive, often processing entire
volumes that contain many anatomically irrelevant slices. Meanwhile, 2D methods
suffer from class imbalance and lack cross-view contextual awareness. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel, anatomically-aware slice
selector pipeline that reduces input volume prior to segmentation. Our unified
framework introduces a vision-language model (VLM) for cross-view organ
presence detection using fused tri-slice (2.5D) representations from axial,
sagittal, and coronal planes. Our proposed model acts as an "expert" in
anatomical localization, reasoning over multi-view representations to
selectively retain slices with high structural relevance. This enables
spatially consistent filtering across orientations while preserving contextual
cues. More importantly, since standard segmentation metrics such as Dice or IoU
fail to measure the spatial precision of such slice selection, we introduce a
novel metric, Slice Localization Concordance (SLC), which jointly captures
anatomical coverage and spatial alignment with organ-centric reference slices.
Unlike segmentation-specific metrics, SLC provides a model-agnostic evaluation
of localization fidelity. Our model offers substantial improvement gains
against several baselines across all organs, demonstrating both accurate and
reliable organ-focused slice filtering. These results show that our method
enables efficient and spatially consistent organ filtering, thereby
significantly reducing downstream segmentation cost while maintaining high
anatomical fidelity.

Motivation: 现有方法无法自动分割海马体亚区，特别是免疫组化图像，限制了疾病机制和神经科学研究的发展。

Method: 提出ROIsGAN，一种基于U-Net的区域引导生成对抗网络，结合Dice和二值交叉熵损失优化边界和结构细节。

Conclusion: 该研究为海马体亚区自动分割提供了基础数据集和方法，推动了神经科学研究的可扩展性和高精度分析。

Abstract: The hippocampus, a critical brain structure involved in memory processing and
various neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, comprises three key
subregions: the dentate gyrus (DG), Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1), and Cornu Ammonis 3
(CA3). Accurate segmentation of these subregions from histological tissue
images is essential for advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms,
developmental dynamics, and therapeutic interventions. However, no existing
methods address the automated segmentation of hippocampal subregions from
tissue images, particularly from immunohistochemistry (IHC) images. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel set of four comprehensive murine hippocampal IHC
datasets featuring distinct staining modalities: cFos, NeuN, and multiplexed
stains combining cFos, NeuN, and either {\Delta}FosB or GAD67, capturing
structural, neuronal activity, and plasticity associated information.
Additionally, we propose ROIsGAN, a region-guided U-Net-based generative
adversarial network tailored for hippocampal subregion segmentation. By
leveraging adversarial learning, ROIsGAN enhances boundary delineation and
structural detail refinement through a novel region-guided discriminator loss
combining Dice and binary cross-entropy loss. Evaluated across DG, CA1, and CA3
subregions, ROIsGAN consistently outperforms conventional segmentation models,
achieving performance gains ranging from 1-10% in Dice score and up to 11% in
Intersection over Union (IoU), particularly under challenging staining
conditions. Our work establishes foundational datasets and methods for
automated hippocampal segmentation, enabling scalable, high-precision analysis
of tissue images in neuroscience research. Our generated datasets, proposed
model as a standalone tool, and its corresponding source code are publicly

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，C2-STi在单切片和多切片ST插值上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: C2-STi为ST插值提供了高效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a promising technique that characterizes the
spatial gene profiling patterns within the tissue context. Comprehensive ST
analysis depends on consecutive slices for 3D spatial insights, whereas the
missing intermediate tissue sections and high costs limit the practical
feasibility of generating multi-slice ST. In this paper, we propose C2-STi, the
first attempt for interpolating missing ST slices at arbitrary intermediate
positions between adjacent ST slices. Despite intuitive, effective ST
interpolation presents significant challenges, including 1) limited continuity
across heterogeneous tissue sections, 2) complex intrinsic correlation across
genes, and 3) intricate cellular structures and biological semantics within
each tissue section. To mitigate these challenges, in C2-STi, we design 1) a
distance-aware local structural modulation module to adaptively capture
cross-slice deformations and enhance positional correlations between ST slices,
2) a pyramid gene co-expression correlation module to capture multi-scale
biological associations among genes, and 3) a cross-modal alignment module that
integrates the ST-paired hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained images to filter
and align the essential cellular features across ST and H\&E images. Extensive
experiments on the public dataset demonstrate our superiority over
state-of-the-art approaches on both single-slice and multi-slice ST
interpolation. Codes are available at

Motivation: AI自动分割在临床应用中可能因训练数据与临床案例特征不同而性能下降，需改进模型以适应多样化条件。

Method: 通过精炼预训练变压器为HTN，使用包含不同对比度和扫描位置的CT扫描数据集进行训练和验证。

Conclusion: HTN模型适应性强，适合临床使用，尤其在数据有限的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: AI automated segmentations for radiation treatment planning (RTP) can
deteriorate when applied in clinical cases with different characteristics than
training dataset. Hence, we refined a pretrained transformer into a hybrid
transformer convolutional network (HTN) to segment cardiac substructures lung
and breast cancer patients acquired with varying imaging contrasts and patient
scan positions. Cohort I, consisting of 56 contrast-enhanced (CECT) and 124
non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans from patients with non-small cell lung cancers
acquired in supine position, was used to create oracle with all 180 training
cases and balanced (CECT: 32, NCCT: 32 training) HTN models. Models were
evaluated on a held-out validation set of 60 cohort I patients and 66 patients
with breast cancer from cohort II acquired in supine (n=45) and prone (n=21)
positions. Accuracy was measured using DSC, HD95, and dose metrics. Publicly
available TotalSegmentator served as the benchmark. The oracle and balanced
models were similarly accurate (DSC Cohort I: 0.80 \pm 0.10 versus 0.81 \pm
0.10; Cohort II: 0.77 \pm 0.13 versus 0.80 \pm 0.12), outperforming
TotalSegmentator. The balanced model, using half the training cases as oracle,
produced similar dose metrics as manual delineations for all cardiac
substructures. This model was robust to CT contrast in 6 out of 8 substructures
and patient scan position variations in 5 out of 8 substructures and showed low
correlations of accuracy to patient size and age. A HTN demonstrated robustly
accurate (geometric and dose metrics) cardiac substructures segmentation from
CTs with varying imaging and patient characteristics, one key requirement for
clinical use. Moreover, the model combining pretraining with balanced
distribution of NCCT and CECT scans was able to provide reliably accurate
segmentations under varied conditions with far fewer labeled datasets compared
to an oracle model.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image processing and analysis has important application value
in remote sensing, agriculture and environmental monitoring, but its high
dimensionality, data redundancy and noise interference etc. bring great
challenges to the analysis. Traditional models have limitations in dealing with
these complex data, and it is difficult to meet the increasing demand for
analysis. In recent years, Diffusion Model, as an emerging generative model,
has shown unique advantages in hyperspectral image processing. By simulating
the diffusion process of data in time, the Diffusion Model can effectively
process high-dimensional data, generate high-quality samples, and perform well
in denoising and data enhancement. In this paper, we review the recent research
advances in diffusion modeling for hyperspectral image processing and analysis,
and discuss its applications in tasks such as high-dimensional data processing,
noise removal, classification, and anomaly detection. The performance of
diffusion-based models on image processing is compared and the challenges are
summarized. It is shown that the diffusion model can significantly improve the
accuracy and efficiency of hyperspectral image analysis, providing a new
direction for future research.

Abstract: Comprehensive assessment of the various aspects of the brain's microstructure
requires the use of complementary imaging techniques. This includes measuring
the spatial distribution of cell bodies (cytoarchitecture) and nerve fibers
(myeloarchitecture). The gold standard for cytoarchitectonic analysis is light
microscopic imaging of cell-body stained tissue sections. To reveal the 3D
orientations of nerve fibers, 3D Polarized Light Imaging (3D-PLI) has been
introduced as a reliable technique providing a resolution in the micrometer
range while allowing processing of series of complete brain sections. 3D-PLI
acquisition is label-free and allows subsequent staining of sections after
measurement. By post-staining for cell bodies, a direct link between fiber- and
cytoarchitecture can potentially be established within the same section.
However, inevitable distortions introduced during the staining process make a
nonlinear and cross-modal registration necessary in order to study the detailed
relationships between cells and fibers in the images. In addition, the
complexity of processing histological sections for post-staining only allows
for a limited number of samples. In this work, we take advantage of deep
learning methods for image-to-image translation to generate a virtual staining
of 3D-PLI that is spatially aligned at the cellular level. In a supervised
setting, we build on a unique dataset of brain sections, to which Cresyl violet
staining has been applied after 3D-PLI measurement. To ensure high
correspondence between both modalities, we address the misalignment of training
data using Fourier-based registration methods. In this way, registration can be
efficiently calculated during training for local image patches of target and
predicted staining. We demonstrate that the proposed method enables prediction
of a Cresyl violet staining from 3D-PLI, matching individual cell instances.

Abstract: Cluttered garments manipulation poses significant challenges due to the
complex, deformable nature of garments and intricate garment relations. Unlike
single-garment manipulation, cluttered scenarios require managing complex
garment entanglements and interactions, while maintaining garment cleanliness
and manipulation stability. To address these demands, we propose to learn
point-level affordance, the dense representation modeling the complex space and
multi-modal manipulation candidates, while being aware of garment geometry,
structure, and inter-object relations. Additionally, as it is difficult to
directly retrieve a garment in some extremely entangled clutters, we introduce
an adaptation module, guided by learned affordance, to reorganize
highly-entangled garments into states plausible for manipulation. Our framework
demonstrates effectiveness over environments featuring diverse garment types
and pile configurations in both simulation and the real world. Project page:

*Julian Wolter,Amr Gomaa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于数据驱动的方法，利用人类交互数据训练AI模型，以减少工业自动化中不必要的控制转移（ToC）事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主系统在各行业中的普及，传统故障处理方法（如ToC）在非关键情况下常被不必要地触发，影响系统可靠性。

Method: 通过模拟工业吸尘器的交互工具收集数据，开发基于LSTM的模型预测用户行为。

Result: 实验表明，即使是非专家的数据也能有效训练模型，减少不必要的ToC事件，提升系统鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了AI通过学习人类问题解决行为，结合传感器数据提升工业自动化与人机协作的潜力。

Abstract: As autonomous systems become integral to various industries, effective
strategies for fault handling are essential to ensure reliability and
efficiency. Transfer of Control (ToC), a traditional approach for interrupting
automated processes during faults, is often triggered unnecessarily in
non-critical situations. To address this, we propose a data-driven method that
uses human interaction data to train AI models capable of preemptively
identifying and addressing issues or assisting users in resolution. Using an
interactive tool simulating an industrial vacuum cleaner, we collected data and
developed an LSTM-based model to predict user behavior. Our findings reveal
that even data from non-experts can effectively train models to reduce
unnecessary ToC events, enhancing the system's robustness. This approach
highlights the potential of AI to learn directly from human problem-solving
behaviors, complementing sensor data to improve industrial automation and
human-AI collaboration.

Result: 模糊REs使规划成功率下降高达77.9%，新方法显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 任务导向的上下文认知方法有效解决了模糊REs问题，提升了机器人任务规划的实用性。

Abstract: Robot task planning decomposes human instructions into executable action
sequences that enable robots to complete a series of complex tasks. Although
recent large language model (LLM)-based task planners achieve amazing
performance, they assume that human instructions are clear and straightforward.
However, real-world users are not experts, and their instructions to robots
often contain significant vagueness. Linguists suggest that such vagueness
frequently arises from referring expressions (REs), whose meanings depend
heavily on dialogue context and environment. This vagueness is even more
prevalent among the elderly and children, who robots should serve more. This
paper studies how such vagueness in REs within human instructions affects
LLM-based robot task planning and how to overcome this issue. To this end, we
propose the first robot task planning benchmark with vague REs (REI-Bench),
where we discover that the vagueness of REs can severely degrade robot planning
performance, leading to success rate drops of up to 77.9%. We also observe that
most failure cases stem from missing objects in planners. To mitigate the REs
issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach: task-oriented context
cognition, which generates clear instructions for robots, achieving
state-of-the-art performance compared to aware prompt and chains of thought.
This work contributes to the research community of human-robot interaction
(HRI) by making robot task planning more practical, particularly for non-expert
users, e.g., the elderly and children.

for building temporal digital twins of plants by combining 3D Gaussian
Splatting with a robust sample alignment pipeline. Our method begins by
reconstructing Gaussian Splats from multi-view camera data, then leverages a
two-stage registration approach: coarse alignment through feature-based
matching and Fast Global Registration, followed by fine alignment with
Iterative Closest Point. This pipeline yields a consistent 4D model of plant
development in discrete time steps. We evaluate the approach on data from the

Abstract: Garment manipulation is a critical challenge due to the diversity in garment
categories, geometries, and deformations. Despite this, humans can effortlessly
handle garments, thanks to the dexterity of our hands. However, existing
research in the field has struggled to replicate this level of dexterity,
primarily hindered by the lack of realistic simulations of dexterous garment
manipulation. Therefore, we propose DexGarmentLab, the first environment
specifically designed for dexterous (especially bimanual) garment manipulation,
which features large-scale high-quality 3D assets for 15 task scenarios, and
refines simulation techniques tailored for garment modeling to reduce the
sim-to-real gap. Previous data collection typically relies on teleoperation or
training expert reinforcement learning (RL) policies, which are labor-intensive
and inefficient. In this paper, we leverage garment structural correspondence
to automatically generate a dataset with diverse trajectories using only a
single expert demonstration, significantly reducing manual intervention.
However, even extensive demonstrations cannot cover the infinite states of
garments, which necessitates the exploration of new algorithms. To improve
generalization across diverse garment shapes and deformations, we propose a
Hierarchical gArment-manipuLation pOlicy (HALO). It first identifies
transferable affordance points to accurately locate the manipulation area, then
generates generalizable trajectories to complete the task. Through extensive
experiments and detailed analysis of our method and baseline, we demonstrate
that HALO consistently outperforms existing methods, successfully generalizing
to previously unseen instances even with significant variations in shape and
deformation where others fail. Our project page is available at:

Conclusion: GROQLoco展示了在多足机器人和多样化地形中实现通用运动策略的潜力，无需微调即可部署。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large-scale offline training have demonstrated the
potential of generalist policy learning for complex robotic tasks. However,
applying these principles to legged locomotion remains a challenge due to
continuous dynamics and the need for real-time adaptation across diverse
terrains and robot morphologies. In this work, we propose GROQLoco, a scalable,
attention-based framework that learns a single generalist locomotion policy
across multiple quadruped robots and terrains, relying solely on offline
datasets. Our approach leverages expert demonstrations from two distinct
locomotion behaviors - stair traversal (non-periodic gaits) and flat terrain
traversal (periodic gaits) - collected across multiple quadruped robots, to
train a generalist model that enables behavior fusion for both behaviors.
Crucially, our framework operates directly on proprioceptive data from all
robots without incorporating any robot-specific encodings. The policy is
directly deployable on an Intel i7 nuc, producing low-latency control outputs
without any test-time optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
strong zero-shot transfer across highly diverse quadruped robots and terrains,
including hardware deployment on the Unitree Go1, a commercially available 12kg
robot. Notably, we evaluate challenging cross-robot training setups where
different locomotion skills are unevenly distributed across robots, yet observe
successful transfer of both flat walking and stair traversal behaviors to all
robots at test time. We also show preliminary walking on Stoch 5, a 70kg
quadruped, on flat and outdoor terrains without requiring any fine tuning.
These results highlight the potential for robust generalist locomotion across
diverse robots and terrains.

Conclusion: 该方法具有实际部署潜力，尤其适用于自动驾驶中的多变环境。

Abstract: Accurate velocity estimation is critical in mobile robotics, particularly for
driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. Wheel odometry fused with
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data is a widely used method for velocity
estimation; however, it typically requires strong assumptions, such as non-slip
steering, or complex vehicle dynamics models that do not hold under varying
environmental conditions like slippery surfaces. We introduce an approach to
velocity estimation that is decoupled from wheel-to-surface traction
assumptions by leveraging planar kinematics in combination with optical flow
from event cameras pointed perpendicularly at the ground. The asynchronous
micro-second latency and high dynamic range of event cameras make them highly
robust to motion blur, a common challenge in vision-based perception techniques
for autonomous driving. The proposed method is evaluated through in-field
experiments on a 1:10 scale autonomous racing platform and compared to precise
motion capture data, demonstrating not only performance on par with the
state-of-the-art Event-VIO method but also a 38.3 % improvement in lateral
error. Qualitative experiments at highway speeds of up to 32 m/s further
confirm the effectiveness of our approach, indicating significant potential for
real-world deployment.

Abstract: As robots for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) gradually become more
accessible and modular, we believe there is a great opportunity to rethink and
expand the visualization and control paradigms that have characterized surgical
teleoperation since its inception. We conjecture that introducing one or more
additional adjustable viewpoints in the abdominal cavity would not only unlock
novel visualization and collaboration strategies for surgeons but also
substantially boost the robustness of machine perception toward shared
autonomy. Immediate advantages include controlling a second viewpoint and
teleoperating surgical tools from a different perspective, which would allow
collaborating surgeons to adjust their views independently and still maneuver
their robotic instruments intuitively. Furthermore, we believe that capturing
synchronized multi-view 3D measurements of the patient's anatomy would unlock
advanced scene representations. Accurate real-time intraoperative 3D perception
will allow algorithmic assistants to directly control one or more robotic
instruments and/or robotic cameras. Toward these goals, we are building a
synchronized multi-viewpoint, multi-sensor robotic surgery system by
integrating high-performance vision components and upgrading the da Vinci
Research Kit control logic. This short paper reports a functional summary of
our setup and elaborates on its potential impacts in research and future
clinical practice. By fully open-sourcing our system, we will enable the
research community to reproduce our setup, improve it, and develop powerful
algorithms, effectively boosting clinical translation of cutting-edge research.

Result: 在Graspnet-1billion数据集上，虚拟视角增加了力闭合抓取数量并提升了抓取覆盖率。

Conclusion: 未来可扩展至单图像构建辐射场，结合扩散模型或通用辐射场技术，进一步提升抓取提取效果。

Abstract: Vision based robot manipulation uses cameras to capture one or more images of
a scene containing the objects to be manipulated. Taking multiple images can
help if any object is occluded from one viewpoint but more visible from another
viewpoint. However, the camera has to be moved to a sequence of suitable
positions for capturing multiple images, which requires time and may not always
be possible, due to reachability constraints. So while additional images can
produce more accurate grasp poses due to the extra information available, the
time-cost goes up with the number of additional views sampled. Scene
representations like Gaussian Splatting are capable of rendering accurate
photorealistic virtual images from user-specified novel viewpoints. In this
work, we show initial results which indicate that novel view synthesis can
provide additional context in generating grasp poses. Our experiments on the
Graspnet-1billion dataset show that novel views contributed force-closure
grasps in addition to the force-closure grasps obtained from sparsely sampled
real views while also improving grasp coverage. In the future we hope this work
can be extended to improve grasp extraction from radiance fields constructed
with a single input image, using for example diffusion models or generalizable
radiance fields.

Abstract: Object rearrangement is a key task for household robots requiring
personalization without explicit instructions, meaningful object placement in
environments occupied with objects, and generalization to unseen objects and
new environments. To facilitate research addressing these challenges, we
introduce PARSEC, an object rearrangement benchmark for learning user
organizational preferences from observed scene context to place objects in a
partially arranged environment. PARSEC is built upon a novel dataset of 110K
rearrangement examples crowdsourced from 72 users, featuring 93 object
categories and 15 environments. We also propose ContextSortLM, an LLM-based
rearrangement model that places objects in partially arranged environments by
adapting to user preferences from prior and current scene context while
accounting for multiple valid placements. We evaluate ContextSortLM and
existing personalized rearrangement approaches on the PARSEC benchmark and
complement these findings with a crowdsourced evaluation of 108 online raters
ranking model predictions based on alignment with user preferences. Our results
indicate that personalized rearrangement models leveraging multiple scene
context sources perform better than models relying on a single context source.
Moreover, ContextSortLM outperforms other models in placing objects to
replicate the target user's arrangement and ranks among the top two in all
three environment categories, as rated by online evaluators. Importantly, our
evaluation highlights challenges associated with modeling environment semantics
across different environment categories and provides recommendations for future
work.

Motivation: 扩散策略在视觉-语言-动作模型中表现优异，但训练效率低下，尤其是条件难以区分时，训练目标会退化为建模边际动作分布（损失崩溃）。

Method: 提出Cocos方法，通过使条件流匹配中的源分布依赖于条件输入，增强条件整合，防止损失崩溃。

Result: Cocos在仿真和实际基准测试中表现优异，收敛更快且成功率更高，显著减少梯度步数和参数数量。

Conclusion: Cocos是一种轻量级、易实现且通用的扩散策略训练改进方法。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have emerged as a mainstream paradigm for building
vision-language-action (VLA) models. Although they demonstrate strong robot
control capabilities, their training efficiency remains suboptimal. In this
work, we identify a fundamental challenge in conditional diffusion policy
training: when generative conditions are hard to distinguish, the training
objective degenerates into modeling the marginal action distribution, a
phenomenon we term loss collapse. To overcome this, we propose Cocos, a simple
yet general solution that modifies the source distribution in the conditional
flow matching to be condition-dependent. By anchoring the source distribution
around semantics extracted from condition inputs, Cocos encourages stronger
condition integration and prevents the loss collapse. We provide theoretical
justification and extensive empirical results across simulation and real-world
benchmarks. Our method achieves faster convergence and higher success rates
than existing approaches, matching the performance of large-scale pre-trained
VLAs using significantly fewer gradient steps and parameters. Cocos is
lightweight, easy to implement, and compatible with diverse policy
architectures, offering a general-purpose improvement to diffusion policy
training.

Abstract: Generative skill acquisition enables embodied agents to actively learn a
scalable and evolving repertoire of control skills, crucial for the advancement
of large decision models. While prior approaches often rely on supervision
signals from generalist agents (e.g., LLMs), their effectiveness in complex 3D
environments remains unclear; exhaustive evaluation incurs substantial
computational costs, significantly hindering the efficiency of skill learning.
Inspired by recent successes in verification models for mathematical reasoning,
we propose VERGSA (Verifying Embodied Reasoning in Generative Skill
Acquisition), a framework that systematically integrates real-time verification
principles into embodied skill learning. VERGSA establishes 1) a seamless
extension from verification of mathematical reasoning into embodied learning by
dynamically incorporating contextually relevant tasks into prompts and defining
success metrics for both subtasks and overall tasks, and 2) an automated,
scalable reward labeling scheme that synthesizes dense reward signals by
iteratively finalizing the contribution of scene configuration and subtask
learning to overall skill acquisition. To the best of our knowledge, this
approach constitutes the first comprehensive training dataset for
verification-driven generative skill acquisition, eliminating arduous manual
reward engineering. Experiments validate the efficacy of our approach: 1) the
exemplar task pool improves the average task success rates by 21%, 2) our
verification model boosts success rates by 24% for novel tasks and 36% for
encountered tasks, and 3) outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge baselines in verification
quality.

TL;DR: LLM-Explorer是一种高效且经济的移动应用探索代理，通过减少对大型语言模型（LLM）的依赖，专注于知识维护而非动作生成，显著降低了成本并提高了覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的探索方法过度依赖LLM生成动作，导致高昂的token费用和计算资源消耗，且效果不佳。

Method: LLM-Explorer利用LLM维护知识而非生成动作，通过知识指导动作生成，减少LLM的使用。

Result: 在20个典型应用上与5个基线对比，LLM-Explorer实现了最快的速度和最高的覆盖率，成本比现有LLM方法低148倍。

Conclusion: LLM-Explorer证明了减少LLM依赖的有效性，为自动化移动应用探索提供了高效且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automated
mobile app exploration, an important and challenging problem that used to
suffer from the difficulty of generating meaningful UI interactions. However,
existing LLM-based exploration approaches rely heavily on LLMs to generate
actions in almost every step, leading to a huge cost of token fees and
computational resources. We argue that such extensive usage of LLMs is neither
necessary nor effective, since many actions during exploration do not require,
or may even be biased by the abilities of LLMs. Further, based on the insight
that a precise and compact knowledge plays the central role for effective
exploration, we introduce LLM-Explorer, a new exploration agent designed for
efficiency and affordability. LLM-Explorer uses LLMs primarily for maintaining
the knowledge instead of generating actions, and knowledge is used to guide
action generation in a LLM-less manner. Based on a comparison with 5 strong
baselines on 20 typical apps, LLM-Explorer was able to achieve the fastest and
highest coverage among all automated app explorers, with over 148x lower cost
than the state-of-the-art LLM-based approach.

TL;DR: VulTrial是一个多代理框架，通过角色分工（安全研究员、代码作者、主持人和评审委员会）提升漏洞检测性能，实验表明其优于单代理和多代理基线，尤其在GPT-4o上表现显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 源代码漏洞检测具有挑战性，尤其是当良性代码与漏洞代码相似时，需要更高效的自动化检测方法。

Method: 采用多代理框架VulTrial，包含四个角色分工的代理，并通过实验验证其在GPT-3.5和GPT-4o上的性能。

Result: VulTrial在GPT-4o上性能提升102.39%和84.17%，角色特定指令调优进一步提升了139.89%和118.30%。

Conclusion: VulTrial在多代理设置中显著提升漏洞检测性能，且通过成本优化模型（如GPT-3.5）可平衡性能与成本。

Abstract: Detecting vulnerabilities in source code remains a critical yet challenging
task, especially when benign and vulnerable functions share significant
similarities. In this work, we introduce VulTrial, a courtroom-inspired
multi-agent framework designed to enhance automated vulnerability detection. It
employs four role-specific agents, which are security researcher, code author,
moderator, and review board. Through extensive experiments using GPT-3.5 and
GPT-4o we demonstrate that Vultrial outperforms single-agent and multi-agent
baselines. Using GPT-4o, VulTrial improves the performance by 102.39% and
84.17% over its respective baseline. Additionally, we show that role-specific
instruction tuning in multi-agent with small data (50 pair samples) improves
the performance of VulTrial further by 139.89% and 118.30%. Furthermore, we
analyze the impact of increasing the number of agent interactions on VulTrial's
overall performance. While multi-agent setups inherently incur higher costs due
to increased token usage, our findings reveal that applying VulTrial to a
cost-effective model like GPT-3.5 can improve its performance by 69.89%
compared to GPT-4o in a single-agent setting, at a lower overall cost.

TL;DR: DecompileBench是一个评估反编译器的综合框架，通过真实世界函数提取、运行时感知验证和自动化人本评估，比较了六种工业级反编译器和六种基于LLM的方法，发现LLM方法在代码可理解性上优于商业工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反编译器评估方法主要关注语法正确性，忽略了语义保真度和分析师可用性等实际需求。

Method: DecompileBench通过真实世界函数提取、运行时感知验证和LLM-as-Judge自动化评估，系统比较了六种工业级反编译器和六种基于LLM的方法。

Result: LLM方法在代码可理解性上优于商业工具，尽管功能正确性低52.2%。

Conclusion: LLM方法有望改变人本逆向工程，DecompileBench开源以推动反编译器研究并帮助安全专家选择工具。

Abstract: Decompilers are fundamental tools for critical security tasks, from
vulnerability discovery to malware analysis, yet their evaluation remains
fragmented. Existing approaches primarily focus on syntactic correctness
through synthetic micro-benchmarks or subjective human ratings, failing to
address real-world requirements for semantic fidelity and analyst usability. We
present DecompileBench, the first comprehensive framework that enables
effective evaluation of decompilers in reverse engineering workflows through
three key components: \textit{real-world function extraction} (comprising
23,400 functions from 130 real-world programs), \textit{runtime-aware
validation}, and \textit{automated human-centric assessment} using LLM-as-Judge
to quantify the effectiveness of decompilers in reverse engineering workflows.
Through a systematic comparison between six industrial-strength decompilers and
six recent LLM-powered approaches, we demonstrate that LLM-based methods
surpass commercial tools in code understandability despite 52.2% lower
functionality correctness. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based
approaches to transform human-centric reverse engineering. We open source
\href{https://github.com/Jennieett/DecompileBench}{DecompileBench} to provide a
framework to advance research on decompilers and assist security experts in
making informed tool selections based on their specific requirements.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI agents requires robust mechanisms for secure
discovery. This paper introduces the Agent Name Service (ANS), a novel
architecture based on DNS addressing the lack of a public agent discovery
framework. ANS provides a protocol-agnostic registry infrastructure that
leverages Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates for verifiable agent
identity and trust. The architecture features several key innovations: a
formalized agent registration and renewal mechanism for lifecycle management;
DNS-inspired naming conventions with capability-aware resolution; a modular
Protocol Adapter Layer supporting diverse communication standards (A2A, MCP,
ACP etc.); and precisely defined algorithms for secure resolution. We implement
structured communication using JSON Schema and conduct a comprehensive threat
analysis of our proposal. The result is a foundational directory service
addressing the core challenges of secured discovery and interaction in
multi-agent systems, paving the way for future interoperable, trustworthy, and
scalable agent ecosystems.

Motivation: 在快速变化的数字环境中，企业需确保系统安全，但传统审计耗时耗力，因此研究利用LLM提高审计效率。

Method: 通过GPT-4与Langchain的实验，开发框架以自动化执行密码策略合规性审计。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能准确标记密码策略违规，效率高于人工审计。

Conclusion: 尽管在复杂动态环境中可能存在局限性，但框架可扩展至实时威胁监控和合规检查。

Abstract: In the current rapidly changing digital environment, businesses are under
constant stress to ensure that their systems are secured. Security audits help
to maintain a strong security posture by ensuring that policies are in place,
controls are implemented, gaps are identified for cybersecurity risks
mitigation. However, audits are usually manual, requiring much time and costs.
This paper looks at the possibility of developing a framework to leverage Large
Language Models (LLMs) as an autonomous agent to execute part of the security
audit, namely with the field audit. password policy compliance for Windows
operating system. Through the conduct of an exploration experiment of using
GPT-4 with Langchain, the agent executed the audit tasks by accurately flagging
password policy violations and appeared to be more efficient than traditional
manual audits. Despite its potential limitations in operational consistency in
complex and dynamic environment, the framework suggests possibilities to extend
further to real-time threat monitoring and compliance checks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MCP协议的广泛应用，第三方定制版本暴露了潜在安全漏洞，尤其是偏好操纵攻击（MPMA）可能破坏生态公平性。

Method: 研究首先设计了直接偏好操纵攻击（DPMA），随后提出基于遗传算法的广告偏好操纵攻击（GAPMA），通过初始化描述和遗传算法优化隐蔽性。

Result: 实验证明GAPMA在攻击效果和隐蔽性上取得平衡，揭示了MCP生态系统的关键漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁开发更强大的防御机制，以确保MCP生态系统的公平性。

Abstract: Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes interface mapping for large
language models (LLMs) to access external data and tools, which revolutionizes
the paradigm of tool selection and facilitates the rapid expansion of the LLM
agent tool ecosystem. However, as the MCP is increasingly adopted, third-party
customized versions of the MCP server expose potential security
vulnerabilities. In this paper, we first introduce a novel security threat,
which we term the MCP Preference Manipulation Attack (MPMA). An attacker
deploys a customized MCP server to manipulate LLMs, causing them to prioritize
it over other competing MCP servers. This can result in economic benefits for
attackers, such as revenue from paid MCP services or advertising income
generated from free servers. To achieve MPMA, we first design a Direct
Preference Manipulation Attack ($\mathtt{DPMA}$) that achieves significant
effectiveness by inserting the manipulative word and phrases into the tool name
and description. However, such a direct modification is obvious to users and
lacks stealthiness. To address these limitations, we further propose
Genetic-based Advertising Preference Manipulation Attack ($\mathtt{GAPMA}$).
$\mathtt{GAPMA}$ employs four commonly used strategies to initialize
descriptions and integrates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to enhance stealthiness.
The experiment results demonstrate that $\mathtt{GAPMA}$ balances high
effectiveness and stealthiness. Our study reveals a critical vulnerability of
the MCP in open ecosystems, highlighting an urgent need for robust defense
mechanisms to ensure the fairness of the MCP ecosystem.

Motivation: 基于Gohr等人在CRYPTO 2019的研究，神经网络能够发现未使用的特征，为密码分析提供新视角。作者希望通过神经网络进一步探索积分特性，优化现有方法。

Method: 采用神经网络学习积分特性，开发了一种中间相遇搜索框架，平衡模型精度和计算效率。

Result: 减少了SKINNY64/64的11轮积分区分器所需的活跃明文比特数，并发现12轮密钥依赖积分区分器。此外，还发现了7轮密钥无关和8轮密钥依赖积分区分器，提升了密钥恢复攻击的效率。

Conclusion: 神经网络为密码分析提供了新工具，显著提升了积分区分器的发现效率和攻击能力，推动了密码分析方法的进步。

Abstract: The study by Gohr et.al at CRYPTO 2019 and sunsequent related works have
shown that neural networks can uncover previously unused features, offering
novel insights into cryptanalysis. Motivated by these findings, we employ
neural networks to learn features specifically related to integral properties
and integrate the corresponding insights into optimized search frameworks.
These findings validate the framework of using neural networks for feature
exploration, providing researchers with novel insights that advance established
cryptanalysis methods.
  Neural networks have inspired the development of more precise integral search
models. By comparing the integral distinguishers obtained via neural networks
with those identified by classical methods, we observe that existing automated
search models often fail to find optimal distinguishers. To address this issue,
we develop a meet in the middle search framework that balances model accuracy
and computational efficiency. As a result, we reduce the number of active
plaintext bits required for an 11 rounds integral distinguisher on SKINNY64/64,
and further identify a 12 rounds key dependent integral distinguisher achieving
one additional round over the previous best-known result.
  The integral distinguishers discovered by neural networks enable key recovery
attacks on more rounds. We identify a 7 rounds key independent integral
distinguisher from neural networks with even only one active plaintext cell,
which is based on linear combinations of bits. This distinguisher enables a 15
rounds key recovery attack on SKINNYn/n, improving upon the previous record by
one round. Additionally, we discover an 8 rounds key dependent integral
distinguisher using neural network that further reduces the time complexity of
key recovery attacks against SKINNY.

Motivation: 分层数据结构中隐私保护与数据效用之间的平衡是一个关键挑战，标准隐私保护机制（如差分隐私）需要优化隐私预算分配以避免数据无用或隐私不足。

Result: 实验表明，最优隐私预算分配显著提升了发布数据的效用，并改善了下游任务的性能。

Conclusion: 本文方法为分层数据发布中的隐私预算分配提供了有效解决方案，平衡了隐私保护与数据实用性。

Abstract: Releasing useful information from datasets with hierarchical structures while
preserving individual privacy presents a significant challenge. Standard
privacy-preserving mechanisms, and in particular Differential Privacy, often
require careful allocation of a finite privacy budget across different levels
and components of the hierarchy. Sub-optimal allocation can lead to either
excessive noise, rendering the data useless, or to insufficient protections for
sensitive information. This paper addresses the critical problem of optimal
privacy budget allocation for hierarchical data release. It formulates this
challenge as a constrained optimization problem, aiming to maximize data
utility subject to a total privacy budget while considering the inherent
trade-offs between data granularity and privacy loss. The proposed approach is
supported by theoretical analysis and validated through comprehensive
experiments on real hierarchical datasets. These experiments demonstrate that
optimal privacy budget allocation significantly enhances the utility of the
released data and improves the performance of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Malware presents a persistent threat to user privacy and data integrity. To
combat this, machine learning-based (ML-based) malware detection (MD) systems
have been developed. However, these systems have increasingly been attacked in
recent years, undermining their effectiveness in practice. While the security
risks associated with ML-based MD systems have garnered considerable attention,
the majority of prior works is limited to adversarial malware examples, lacking
a comprehensive analysis of practical security risks. This paper addresses this
gap by utilizing the CIA principles to define the scope of security risks. We
then deconstruct ML-based MD systems into distinct operational stages, thus
developing a stage-based taxonomy. Utilizing this taxonomy, we summarize the
technical progress and discuss the gaps in the attack and defense proposals
related to the ML-based MD systems within each stage. Subsequently, we conduct
two case studies, using both inter-stage and intra-stage analyses according to
the stage-based taxonomy to provide new empirical insights. Based on these
analyses and insights, we suggest potential future directions from both
inter-stage and intra-stage perspectives.

Motivation: 研究LLMs如何改变网络攻击的经济性，提出定制化攻击的潜在威胁。

Result: LLMs能高效发现易识别漏洞和敏感信息，部分攻击虽成本较高但未来可能普及。

Conclusion: LLMs的普及将推动新型防御策略的需求，以应对定制化攻击的威胁。

Abstract: We argue that Large language models (LLMs) will soon alter the economics of
cyberattacks. Instead of attacking the most commonly used software and
monetizing exploits by targeting the lowest common denominator among victims,
LLMs enable adversaries to launch tailored attacks on a user-by-user basis. On
the exploitation front, instead of human attackers manually searching for one
difficult-to-identify bug in a product with millions of users, LLMs can find
thousands of easy-to-identify bugs in products with thousands of users. And on
the monetization front, instead of generic ransomware that always performs the
same attack (encrypt all your data and request payment to decrypt), an
LLM-driven ransomware attack could tailor the ransom demand based on the
particular content of each exploited device.
  We show that these two attacks (and several others) are imminently practical
using state-of-the-art LLMs. For example, we show that without any human
intervention, an LLM finds highly sensitive personal information in the Enron
email dataset (e.g., an executive having an affair with another employee) that
could be used for blackmail. While some of our attacks are still too expensive
to scale widely today, the incentives to implement these attacks will only
increase as LLMs get cheaper. Thus, we argue that LLMs create a need for new
defense-in-depth approaches.

Abstract: Probabilistic next-token prediction trained using cross-entropy loss is the
basis of most large language models. Given a sequence of previous values,
next-token prediction assigns a probability to each possible next value in the
vocabulary. There are many ways to use next-token prediction to output token
sequences. This paper examines a few of these algorithms (greedy, lookahead,
random sampling, and temperature-scaled random sampling) and studies their
consistency with respect to various goals encoded as loss functions. Although
consistency of surrogate losses with respect to a target loss function is a
well researched topic, we are the first to study it in the context of LLMs (to
the best of our knowledge). We find that, so long as next-token prediction
converges to its true probability distribution, random sampling is consistent
with outputting sequences that mimic sampling from the true probability
distribution. For the other goals, such as minimizing the 0-1 loss on the
entire sequence, we show no polynomial-time algorithm is optimal for all
probability distributions and all decoding algorithms studied are only optimal
for a subset of probability distributions. When analyzing these results, we see
that there is a dichotomy created between the goals of information retrieval
and creative generation for the decoding algorithms. This shows that choosing
the correct decoding algorithm based on the desired goal is extremely important
and many of the ones used are lacking theoretical grounding in numerous
scenarios.

Conclusion: 通过调整前向过程，可以改善扩散模型在高频成分上的生成质量，同时不影响低频性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models are state-of-the-art generative models on data modalities
such as images, audio, proteins and materials. These modalities share the
property of exponentially decaying variance and magnitude in the Fourier
domain. Under the standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)
forward process of additive white noise, this property results in
high-frequency components being corrupted faster and earlier in terms of their
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) than low-frequency ones. The reverse process then
generates low-frequency information before high-frequency details. In this
work, we study the inductive bias of the forward process of diffusion models in
Fourier space. We theoretically analyse and empirically demonstrate that the
faster noising of high-frequency components in DDPM results in violations of
the normality assumption in the reverse process. Our experiments show that this
leads to degraded generation quality of high-frequency components. We then
study an alternate forward process in Fourier space which corrupts all
frequencies at the same rate, removing the typical frequency hierarchy during
generation, and demonstrate marked performance improvements on datasets where
high frequencies are primary, while performing on par with DDPM on standard
imaging benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable capabilities across
financial tasks, including financial report summarization, earnings call
transcript analysis, and asset classification. However, their real-world
effectiveness in managing complex fund investment remains inadequately
assessed. A fundamental limitation of existing benchmarks for evaluating
LLM-driven trading strategies is their reliance on historical back-testing,
inadvertently enabling LLMs to "time travel"-leveraging future information
embedded in their training corpora, thus resulting in possible information
leakage and overly optimistic performance estimates. To address this issue, we
introduce DeepFund, a live fund benchmark tool designed to rigorously evaluate
LLM in real-time market conditions. Utilizing a multi-agent architecture,
DeepFund connects directly with real-time stock market data-specifically data
published after each model pretraining cutoff-to ensure fair and leakage-free
evaluations. Empirical tests on nine flagship LLMs from leading global
institutions across multiple investment dimensions-including ticker-level
analysis, investment decision-making, portfolio management, and risk
control-reveal significant practical challenges. Notably, even cutting-edge
models such as DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet incur net trading losses
within DeepFund real-time evaluation environment, underscoring the present
limitations of LLMs for active fund management. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于模型上下文协议（MCP）的新型多模态数据分析系统，旨在解决数据湖中多模态数据分析的准确性、效率和时效性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据湖中多模态数据的多样性给数据分析带来挑战，现有大型语言模型（LLMs）在准确性、效率和时效性上表现不足。

Method: 提出基于MCP的架构，包括语义操作符层次结构、AI代理驱动的NL2Operator翻译器、MCP执行框架和更新机制。

Result: 该系统通过模块化部署提升了准确性和效率，并支持数据湖和LLM知识的动态更新。

Conclusion: 该架构为多模态数据分析提供了更高效、准确和时效的解决方案。

Abstract: The variety of data in data lakes presents significant challenges for data
analytics, as data scientists must simultaneously analyze multi-modal data,
including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities, they still
remain inadequate for multi-modal data analytics in terms of accuracy,
efficiency, and freshness. First, current natural language (NL) or SQL-like
query languages may struggle to precisely and comprehensively capture users'
analytical intent. Second, relying on a single unified LLM to process diverse
data modalities often leads to substantial inference overhead. Third, data
stored in data lakes may be incomplete or outdated, making it essential to
integrate external open-domain knowledge to generate timely and relevant
analytics results.
  In this paper, we envision a new multi-modal data analytics system.
Specifically, we propose a novel architecture built upon the Model Context
Protocol (MCP), an emerging paradigm that enables LLMs to collaborate with
knowledgeable agents. First, we define a semantic operator hierarchy tailored
for querying multi-modal data in data lakes and develop an AI-agent-powered
NL2Operator translator to bridge user intent and analytical execution. Next, we
introduce an MCP-based execution framework, in which each MCP server hosts
specialized foundation models optimized for specific data modalities. This
design enhances both accuracy and efficiency, while supporting high scalability
through modular deployment. Finally, we propose a updating mechanism by
harnessing the deep research and machine unlearning techniques to refresh the
data lakes and LLM knowledges, with the goal of balancing the data freshness
and inference efficiency.

*Manisha Mehta,Fausto Giunchiglia*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究评估了AI系统对Alpha世代（2010-2024年出生）数字语言的理解能力，揭示了现有安全工具在检测隐蔽骚扰和操纵方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alpha世代是首个与AI共同成长的群体，其独特的数字语言（如游戏、表情包和AI驱动趋势）导致现有安全工具难以识别有害互动，增加了在线风险。

Method: 研究评估了四种领先AI模型（GPT-4、Claude、Gemini和Llama 3）对Alpha世代表达中隐蔽骚扰的检测能力，使用了100个来自游戏平台、社交媒体和视频内容的样本数据集。

Result: 研究发现AI模型在理解Alpha世代语言时存在显著缺陷，直接影响在线安全。同时，研究提出了改进AI审核系统的框架，并分析了语言差异如何增加青少年脆弱性。

Conclusion: 研究强调需重新设计适应青少年沟通的安全系统，并呼吁结合Alpha世代研究者的视角与学术分析，以应对数字安全挑战。

Abstract: This research offers a unique evaluation of how AI systems interpret the
digital language of Generation Alpha (Gen Alpha, born 2010-2024). As the first
cohort raised alongside AI, Gen Alpha faces new forms of online risk due to
immersive digital engagement and a growing mismatch between their evolving
communication and existing safety tools. Their distinct language, shaped by
gaming, memes, and AI-driven trends, often conceals harmful interactions from
both human moderators and automated systems. We assess four leading AI models
(GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and Llama 3) on their ability to detect masked
harassment and manipulation within Gen Alpha discourse. Using a dataset of 100
recent expressions from gaming platforms, social media, and video content, the
study reveals critical comprehension failures with direct implications for
online safety. This work contributes: (1) a first-of-its-kind dataset capturing
Gen Alpha expressions; (2) a framework to improve AI moderation systems for
youth protection; (3) a multi-perspective evaluation including AI systems,
human moderators, and parents, with direct input from Gen Alpha co-researchers;
and (4) an analysis of how linguistic divergence increases youth vulnerability.
Findings highlight the urgent need to redesign safety systems attuned to youth
communication, especially given Gen Alpha reluctance to seek help when adults
fail to understand their digital world. This study combines the insight of a
Gen Alpha researcher with systematic academic analysis to address critical
digital safety challenges.

Motivation: 研究AI能力对股票估值的锚定效应，揭示市场估值与AI实际表现之间的差距。

Method: 使用2023-2025年生成式AI繁荣期的数据，分析行业敏感性，并通过案例研究（如OpenAI、Adobe等）展示估值溢价模式。

Result: AI原生公司因未来潜力获得高估值溢价，而传统公司需证明实际回报才能重新评级。CRR模型可识别估值错配风险。

Conclusion: 建议通过政策提高透明度，减少投机泡沫，使AI创新与可持续市场价值保持一致。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) have triggered surges in
market valuations for AI-related companies, often outpacing the realization of
underlying capabilities. We examine the anchoring effect of AI capabilities on
equity valuations and propose a Capability Realization Rate (CRR) model to
quantify the gap between AI potential and realized performance. Using data from
the 2023--2025 generative AI boom, we analyze sector-level sensitivity and
conduct case studies (OpenAI, Adobe, NVIDIA, Meta, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs) to
illustrate patterns of valuation premium and misalignment. Our findings
indicate that AI-native firms commanded outsized valuation premiums anchored to
future potential, while traditional companies integrating AI experienced
re-ratings subject to proof of tangible returns. We argue that CRR can help
identify valuation misalignment risk-where market prices diverge from realized
AI-driven value. We conclude with policy recommendations to improve
transparency, mitigate speculative bubbles, and align AI innovation with
sustainable market value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏对开源与专有生成式AI系统的全面比较研究，需要评估其风险与挑战。

Result: 开源模型更具透明度和灵活性，而专有系统提供更好的技术支持但缺乏问责制。

Conclusion: 多利益相关方治理、环境可持续性和监管框架对负责任的发展至关重要。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) systems represent a critical
technology with far-reaching implications across multiple domains of society.
However, their deployment entails a range of risks and challenges that require
careful evaluation. To date, there has been a lack of comprehensive,
interdisciplinary studies offering a systematic comparison between open-source
and proprietary (closed) generative AI systems, particularly regarding their
respective advantages and drawbacks. This study aims to: i) critically evaluate
and compare the characteristics, opportunities, and challenges of open and
closed generative AI models; and ii) propose foundational elements for the
development of an Open, Public, and Safe Gen AI framework. As a methodology, we
adopted a combined approach that integrates three methods: literature review,
critical analysis, and comparative analysis. The proposed framework outlines
key dimensions, openness, public governance, and security, as essential pillars
for shaping the future of trustworthy and inclusive Gen AI. Our findings reveal
that open models offer greater transparency, auditability, and flexibility,
enabling independent scrutiny and bias mitigation. In contrast, closed systems
often provide better technical support and ease of implementation, but at the
cost of unequal access, accountability, and ethical oversight. The research
also highlights the importance of multi-stakeholder governance, environmental
sustainability, and regulatory frameworks in ensuring responsible development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工分析大量异构数据源常导致延迟，影响干预效果，因此需要自动化系统提升时效性和准确性。

Method: 系统通过动态构建查询特定知识库整合实时数据，并采用三级评估框架（NLP指标、专家反馈、LLM评估）确保报告质量。

Conclusion: 该自动化方法显著提升了情况感知的效率和准确性，代码和工具已开源以促进研究。

Abstract: Timely and accurate situation awareness is vital for decision-making in
humanitarian response, conflict monitoring, and early warning and early action.
However, the manual analysis of vast and heterogeneous data sources often
results in delays, limiting the effectiveness of interventions. This paper
introduces a dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that
autonomously generates situation awareness reports by integrating real-time
data from diverse sources, including news articles, conflict event databases,
and economic indicators. Our system constructs query-specific knowledge bases
on demand, ensuring timely, relevant, and accurate insights.
  To ensure the quality of generated reports, we propose a three-level
evaluation framework that combines semantic similarity metrics, factual
consistency checks, and expert feedback. The first level employs automated NLP
metrics to assess coherence and factual accuracy. The second level involves
human expert evaluation to verify the relevance and completeness of the
reports. The third level utilizes LLM-as-a-Judge, where large language models
provide an additional layer of assessment to ensure robustness. The system is
tested across multiple real-world scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in
producing coherent, insightful, and actionable reports. By automating report
generation, our approach reduces the burden on human analysts and accelerates
decision-making processes. To promote reproducibility and further research, we
openly share our code and evaluation tools with the community via GitHub.

Method: 使用图像处理和OCR技术构建数据管道，分析五家报纸的广告数据。

Result: 发现印刷广告量稳定，公司广告多位于显著版面，政府广告贡献高收入；广告量与媒体报道正相关。

Conclusion: 广告量与媒体报道的正面性和广泛性显著相关，这一关系在不同广告商中均成立。

Abstract: This paper investigates advertising practices in print newspapers across
India using a novel data-driven approach. We develop a pipeline employing image
processing and OCR techniques to extract articles and advertisements from
digital versions of print newspapers with high accuracy. Applying this
methodology to five popular newspapers that span multiple regions and three
languages, English, Hindi, and Telugu, we assembled a dataset of more than
12,000 editions containing several hundred thousand advertisements.
Collectively, these newspapers reach a readership of over 100 million people.
Using this extensive dataset, we conduct a comprehensive analysis to answer key
questions about print advertising: who advertises, what they advertise, when
they advertise, where they place their ads, and how they advertise. Our
findings reveal significant patterns, including the consistent level of print
advertising over the past six years despite declining print circulation, the
overrepresentation of company ads on prominent pages, and the disproportionate
revenue contributed by government ads. Furthermore, we examine whether
advertising in a newspaper influences the coverage an advertiser receives.
Through regression analyses on coverage volume and sentiment, we find strong
evidence supporting this hypothesis for corporate advertisers. The results
indicate a clear trend where increased advertising correlates with more
favorable and extensive media coverage, a relationship that remains robust over
time and across different levels of advertiser popularity.

Abstract: If an active citizen should increasingly be a computationally enlightened
one, replacing the autonomy of reason with the heteronomy of algorithms, then I
argue in this article that we must begin teaching the principles of critiquing
the computal through new notions of what we might call digital Bildung. Indeed,
if civil society itself is mediated by computational systems and media, the
public use of reason must also be complemented by skills for negotiating and
using these computal forms to articulate such critique. Not only is there a
need to raise the intellectual tone regarding computation and its related
softwarization processes, but there is an urgent need to attend to the likely
epistemic challenges from computation which, as presently constituted, tends
towards justification through a philosophy of utility rather than through a
philosophy of care for the territory of the intellect. We therefore need to
develop an approach to this field that uses concepts and methods drawn from
philosophy, politics, history, anthropology, sociology, media studies, computer
science, and the humanities more generally, to try to understand these issues -
particularly the way in which software and data increasingly penetrate our
everyday life and the pressures and fissures that are created. We must, in
other words, move to undertake a critical interdisciplinary research program to
understand the way in which these systems are created, instantiated, and
normatively engendered in both specific and general contexts.

Motivation: 推荐系统中的交互稀疏性是主要障碍，尤其是在用户和产品基数不成比例或新实体冷启动的情况下。现有方法要么资源需求高，要么受限于数据质量和可用性。

Method: 提出IKGR框架，利用检索增强生成和编码方法构建知识图谱，通过学习潜在用户-物品亲和力并通过意图连通性丰富图谱。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，IKGR克服了知识鸿沟，在公开和内部数据集上均显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: IKGR有效解决了推荐系统中的稀疏性问题，并通过意图驱动的推荐提供了可解释性。

Abstract: Interaction sparsity is the primary obstacle for recommendation systems.
Sparsity manifests in environments with disproportional cardinality of
groupings of entities, such as users and products in an online marketplace. It
also is found for newly introduced entities, described as the cold-start
problem. Recent efforts to mitigate this sparsity issue shifts the performance
bottleneck to other areas in the computational pipeline. Those that focus on
enriching sparse representations with connectivity data from other external
sources propose methods that are resource demanding and require careful domain
expert aided addition of this newly introduced data. Others that turn to Large
Language Model (LLM) based recommenders will quickly encounter limitations
surrounding data quality and availability. In this work, we propose LLM-based
Intent Knowledge Graph Recommender (IKGR), a novel framework that leverages
retrieval-augmented generation and an encoding approach to construct and
densify a knowledge graph. IKGR learns latent user-item affinities from an
interaction knowledge graph and further densifies it through mutual intent
connectivity. This addresses sparsity issues and allows the model to make
intent-grounded recommendations with an interpretable embedding translation
layer. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate
that IKGR overcomes knowledge gaps and achieves substantial gains over
state-of-the-art baselines on both publicly available and our internal
recommendation datasets.

Method: 引入用户角色识别和行为逻辑建模任务，利用LLM的世界知识和逻辑推理能力生成虚拟逻辑图，增强推荐性能。

Result: 实验证明，提取的用户-项目逻辑图是一种通用知识，可广泛应用于推荐任务，并在工业和公共数据集上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: TagCF通过显式建模用户角色和行为逻辑，显著提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Recommender systems filter contents/items valuable to users by inferring
preferences from user features and historical behaviors. Mainstream approaches
follow the learning-to-rank paradigm, which focus on discovering and modeling
item topics (e.g., categories), and capturing user preferences on these topics
based on historical interactions. However, this paradigm often neglects the
modeling of user characteristics and their social roles, which are logical
confounders influencing the correlated interest and user preference transition.
To bridge this gap, we introduce the user role identification task and the
behavioral logic modeling task that aim to explicitly model user roles and
learn the logical relations between item topics and user social roles. We show
that it is possible to explicitly solve these tasks through an efficient
integration framework of Large Language Model (LLM) and recommendation systems,
for which we propose TagCF. On the one hand, the exploitation of the LLM's
world knowledge and logic inference ability produces a virtual logic graph that
reveals dynamic and expressive knowledge of users, augmenting the
recommendation performance. On the other hand, the user role aligns the user
behavioral logic with the observed user feedback, refining our understanding of
user behaviors. Additionally, we also show that the extracted user-item logic
graph is empirically a general knowledge that can benefit a wide range of
recommendation tasks, and conduct experiments on industrial and several public
datasets as verification.

Abstract: Understanding and recognizing customer intents in AI systems is crucial,
particularly in domains characterized by short utterances and the cold start
problem, where recommender systems must include new products or services
without sufficient real user data. Customer utterances are characterized by
infrequent word co-occurences and high term variability, which poses
significant challenges for traditional methods in specifying distinct user
needs and preparing synthetic queries. To address this, we propose an agentic
LLM framework for topic modeling and synthetic query generation, which
accelerates the discovery and recognition of customer intents. We first apply
hierarchical topic modeling and intent discovery to expand a human-curated
taxonomy from 36 generic user intents to 278 granular intents, demonstrating
the potential of LLMs to significantly enhance topic specificity and diversity.
Next, to support newly discovered intents and address the cold start problem,
we generate synthetic user query data, which augments real utterances and
reduces dependency on human annotation, especially in low-resource settings.
Topic model experiments show substantial improvements in coherence and
relevance after topic expansion, while synthetic data experiments indicate that
in-class few-shot prompting significantly improves the quality and utility of
synthetic queries without compromising diversity. We also show that
LLM-generated intent descriptions and keywords can effectively substitute for
human-curated versions when used as context for synthetic query generation. Our
research underscores the scalability and utility of LLM agents in topic
modeling and highlights the strategic use of synthetic utterances to enhance
dataset variability and coverage for intent recognition. We present a
comprehensive and robust framework for online discovery and recognition of new
customer intents in dynamic domains.

Abstract: This work presents a user-centric recommendation framework, designed as a
pipeline with four distinct, connected, and customizable phases. These phases
are intended to improve explainability and boost user engagement.
  We have collected the historical Last.fm track playback records of a single
user over approximately 15 years. The collected dataset includes more than
90,000 playbacks and approximately 14,000 unique tracks.
  From track playback records, we have created a dataset of user temporal
contexts (each row is a specific moment when the user listened to certain music
descriptors). As music descriptors, we have used community-contributed Last.fm
tags and Spotify audio features. They represent the music that, throughout
years, the user has been listening to.
  Next, given the most relevant Last.fm tags of a moment (e.g. the hour of the
day), we predict the Spotify audio features that best fit the user preferences
in that particular moment. Finally, we use the predicted audio features to find
tracks similar to these features. The final aim is to recommend (and discover)
tracks that the user may feel like listening to at a particular moment.
  For our initial study case, we have chosen to predict only a single audio
feature target: danceability. The framework, however, allows to include more
target variables.
  The ability to learn the musical habits from a single user can be quite
powerful, and this framework could be extended to other users.
